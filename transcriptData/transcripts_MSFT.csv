More detailed outlook slides will be available on the Microsoft Investor Relations website when we provide outlook commentary on today's call. Microsoft, completed the acquisition of Activision Blizzard, on October 13, 2023. We will share more on the expected impact of the Activision acquisition during the outlook commentary portion of today's call. On this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP items. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's first-quarter performance, in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results. All growth comparisons we make on the call today, relate to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted. We'll also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are the same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rate only. We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission in the transcript and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website. During this call, we'll be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.
Satya Nadella: Thank you, Brett. We are off to a strong start to the fiscal year, driven by the continued strength in Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $31.8 billion in quarterly revenue, up 24%. With Copilots, we are making the age of AI real for people and businesses everywhere. We are rapidly infusing AI across every layer of the tech stack, and for every role and business process to drive productivity gains for our customers. Now I'll highlight examples of our progress starting with infrastructure. Azure again took share as organizations bring their workloads to our cloud. We have the most comprehensive cloud footprint with more than 60 data center regions worldwide, as well as, the best AI infrastructure for both training and inference. And we also have our AI services deployed in more regions, than any other cloud provider. This quarter, we announced the general availability of our next-generation H100 Virtual Machines. Azure AI provides access to best-in-class frontier models from OpenAI and open-source models, including our own, as well as from Meta and Hugging Face, which customers can use to build their own AI apps while meeting specific cost latency, and performance needs. Because of our overall differentiation more than 18,000 organizations now use Azure OpenAI services, including new to Azure customers. And we are expanding our reach with digital-first companies with OpenAI APIs as leading AI start-ups use OpenAI to power their AI solutions, therefore, making them Azure customers as well. We continue to see more cloud migrations with Azure Arc. We're meeting customers where they are, helping them run apps across on-prem edge and multi-cloud environments. We now have 21,000 Arc customers up 140% year-over-year. We are the only other cloud provider to run Oracle's database services, making it simpler for customers to migrate their on-prem Oracle databases to our cloud. Customers like PepsiCo and Vodafone will have access to a seamless fully integrated experience for deploying, managing, and using Oracle database instances on Azure. And we are the cloud of choice for customers' SAP workloads too. Companies like Brother Industries, Hanes, ZEISS, and ZF Group all run SAP on Azure. Now on to data, in the age of Copilots, organizations are looking to consolidate their data estate, that's why with our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform, we are bringing together operational data stores, analytics, and governance. More than 73% of the Fortune 1000 use three or more of our data solutions today. And with Microsoft Fabric, we are unifying compute, storage, and governance into one end-to-end analytical solution with an all-inclusive business model. More than 16,000 customers are actively using Fabric, including over 50% of the Fortune 500. Now on to developers. With GitHub Copilot, we are increasing developer productivity by up to 55%, while helping them stay in the flow and bringing the joy back to coding. We have over 1 million paid Copilot users and more than 37,000 organizations have subscribed to Copilot for business, up 40% quarter-over-quarter with significant traction outside the United States. This quarter we added new capabilities with GitHub Copilot Chat, which are already being used by both digital natives like Shopify, as well as, leading enterprises like Maersk and PwC to supercharge the productivity of their software developers. All up, the number of developers using GitHub has increased 4x since our acquisition five years ago. We've also brought Copilot to Power Platform, enabling anyone to use natural language to create apps, build virtual agents and analyze data. More than 126,000 organizations, including 3M, Equinor, Lumen Technologies, Nationwide, PG&E, and Toyota have all used Copilot in Power Platform to date. EY for example has enabled Copilot for all 170,000 plus Power Platform users at the company. And this quarter we added new Copilot capabilities to Power Pages making it possible to build a data-driven website using just a few sentences or clicks. Finally, Power Apps remains the market leader and low-code no-code development, now with 20 million monthly active users, up 40% year-over-year. Now on to business applications, all-up Dynamics 365 took share for the 10th consecutive quarter. We're using this AI inflection point to redefine our role in business applications. We are becoming the Copilot-led business process transformation layer on top of existing CRM systems like Salesforce. For example, our Sales Copilot help sellers that more than 15,000 organizations including Rockwell Automation, Sandvik Coromant, Securitas, and Teleperformance, personalize customer interactions based on data from third-party CRMs. We're also bringing Copilot to Dynamics 365 to help with everything from suggested actions and content ideas, to faster access to valuable business data. And this quarter, we introduced Copilot in Dynamics 365 Field Service, to help streamline frontline tasks. Now on to industry and cross-industry clouds. In healthcare, our Dragon Ambient eXperience solution helps clinicians automatically document patient interactions at the point of care. It's been used across more than 10 million interactions to date. And with DAX Copilot, we are applying generative AI models to draft high-quality clinical notes in seconds, increasing physician productivity and reducing burnout. For example, Atrium Health, a leading provider in Southeast United States credits DAX Copilot with helping its physicians each save up to 40 minutes per day in documentation time. We are also introducing healthcare data solutions in Microsoft Fabric, enabling providers like Northwestern Medicine and SingHealth to unify health data in a secure, compliant way. And with our Microsoft Cloud for sovereignty, which will become generally available by the end of the calendar year, we offer industry-leading data sovereignty and encryption controls, meeting the specific needs of public sector customers around the world. Now on to the future of work. Copilot is your everyday AI assistant, helping you be more creative in Word, more analytical in Excel, more expressive in PowerPoint, more productive in Outlook, and more collaborative in Teams. Tens of thousands of employees at customers like Bayer, KPMG, Mayo Clinic, Suncorp, and Visa, including 40% of the Fortune 100, are using Copilot as part of our early access program. Customers tell us that once they use Copilot, they can't imagine work without it and we are excited to make it generally available for enterprise customers next week. This quarter, we also introduced a new hero experience in Copilot, helping employees tap into their entire universe of work, data, and knowledge using chat (ph). And the new Copilot Lab helps employees build new work habits for this era of AI, by helping them turn good prompts into great ones. When it comes to Teams, usage continues to grow with more than 320 million monthly active users, making Teams the place to work across chat, collaboration, meetings, and calling. This quarter, we introduced a new version of Teams that is up to 2 times faster, while using 50% less memory and includes seamless cross-tenant communications and collaboration. We've seen nine consecutive quarters of triple-digit revenue growth for Teams Rooms, and more than 10,000 paid customers now use Teams Premium. Teams has also become a multiplayer canvas for business process. There are more than 2,000 apps in Teams Store, and collaborative apps from Adobe, Atlassian and Workday, each exceeded 1 million monthly active users on Teams. And with Viva, we have created a new market category for employee experience, helping companies like Dell, Lloyds Banking Group, and PayPal build high-performance organizations. With skills in Viva, we're bringing together information from Microsoft 365 and LinkedIn to help employers understand workforce gaps, and suggest personalized learning content to address it, all in the flow of work. All up, we continue to see more organizations choose Microsoft 365, and companies across the private and public sectors including Cerberus, Chanel, and DXC Technology, all rely on our Premium E5 offerings for advanced security compliance, voice, and analytics. Now on to Windows, the PC market unit volumes were at roughly pre-pandemic levels and we continue to innovate across Windows, adding differentiated AI-powered experiences to the operating system. We rolled out the biggest update to Windows 11 ever adding 150 new features including new AI-powered experiences in apps, like, Clipchamp, Paint, and Photos, and we introduced Copilot in Windows, the Everyday AI companion, which incorporates the context to the web, your work data and what you are doing on the PC to provide better assistance. We are seeing accelerated Windows 11 deployments worldwide from companies like BP, Eurowings, Kantar, and RBC. Finally, with Windows 365 Boot and Switch, we're making it easier than ever for employees at companies like Crocs, Hamburg Commercial Bank, the ING Bank to get a personalized Windows 365 Cloud PC with Copilot on any device. Now on to security. The speed, scale, and sophistication of cyberattacks today is unparalleled and security is the number one priority for CIOs worldwide. We see high-demand for Security Copilot, the industry's first and most advanced generative AI product, which is now seamlessly integrated with Microsoft 365 Defender. Dozens of organizations including Bridgewater, Fidelity National Financial, and Government of Alberta have been using Copilot in Preview, and early feedback has been positive. And we look forward to bringing Copilot to hundreds of organizations in the coming months as part of the new early access program, so they can improve the productivity of their own, security operation centers and stop threats at machine speeds. More broadly, we continue to take share across all major categories we serve, and our SIEM, Microsoft Sentinel now has more than 25,000 customers in revenue, surpassed $1 billion annual run-rate, and customers in every industry like Booz Allen Hamilton, Grant Thornton and MetLife use our end-to-end solutions to protect their environments. Now on to LinkedIn. We are now applying this new generation of AI to transform how the 985 million members learn, sell and get hired. Membership growth has now accelerated each quarter for over two years in a row. This quarter, we introduced new AI-driven features across all of our businesses, including our learning coach that gives members personalized content guidelines, and tools to help employers find qualified candidates and sellers and marketers attract buyers in a single step. Since introducing AI-assisted messages for recruiters five months ago, three-fourths of them say, it saved them time. And we have seen a nearly 80% increase in members watching AI-related learning courses this quarter. More broadly, we continue to see record engagement and knowledge sharing on the platform. We now have more than 450 million newsletter subscriptions globally, up 3x year-over-year. Premium subscription sign-ups were up 55% year-over-year and our hiring business took share for the fifth consecutive quarter. Now on to search, advertising, and news. With our Copilot for the Web, we are redefining how people use the Internet to search and create. Bing users have engaged in more than 1.9 billion chats, and Microsoft Edge has now gained share for 10 consecutive quarters. This quarter, we introduced new personalized answers, as well as, support for DALL-E 3, helping people get more relevant answers and to create incredibly realistic images with more than 1.8 billion images have been created to-date. And with our Copilot and Shopping, people can find more tailored recommendations and better deals. We're also expanding to new endpoints, bringing Bing to Meta's AI chat experience in order to provide more up-to-date answers, as well as access to real-time search information. Finally, we are integrating this new generation of AI directly into our ad platforms to more effectively connect marketeers to customer intent in chat experiences, both from us as well as customers like Axel Springer and Snap. Now on to gaming. We were delighted to close our acquisition of Activision Blizzard King earlier this month. Together, we will advance our goal of bringing great games to players everywhere on any endpoint. Already with Game Pass, we're redefining how games are distributed, played, and discovered. We set a record for hours played per subscriber this quarter. We released Starfield this quarter to broader acclaim, more than 11 million people have played the game to date. Nearly half of the hours played have been on PC and on launch day, we set a record for the most Game Pass subscriptions added on a single day ever. Minecraft has now surpassed 300 million copies sold, and with Activision Blizzard King, we now adds significant depth to our content portfolio. We will have $13 billion-plus franchises from Candy Crush, Diablo, and Halo to Warcraft, Elder Scrolls and Gears of War. And we're looking forward to one of our strongest first-party holiday lineups ever, including new titles like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and Forza Motorsport. In closing, we are rapidly innovating to expand our opportunity across our consumer and commercial businesses, as we help our customers thrive in this new era. In just a few weeks, we'll be holding our flagship Ignite Conference, where we will introduce more than 100 new products and capabilities, including exciting new AI innovations. I encourage you to tune in. With that, I'll turn it over to Amy.
Amy Hood: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter's revenue was $56.5 billion, up 13% and 12% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.99 and increased 27% and 26% in constant currency. Consistent execution by our sales teams and partners drove a strong start to the fiscal year. Results exceeded expectations and we saw share gains again this quarter across many businesses, as customers adopt our innovative solutions to transform their businesses. In our commercial business, the trends from the prior quarter continued. We saw healthy renewals, particularly in Microsoft 365 E5 and growth of new business continued to be moderated for standalone products sold outside the Microsoft 365 suite. In Azure, as expected the optimization trends were similar to Q4. Higher-than-expected AI consumption contributed to revenue growth in Azure. And our consumer business, PC market unit volumes are returning to pre-pandemic levels. Advertising spend, landed roughly in line with our expectations and in gaming strong engagement helped by the Starfield launch benefited Xbox content and services. Commercial bookings increased 14% and 17% in constant currency, in line with expectations, primarily driven by strong execution across our core annuity sales motions, with continued growth in the number of $10 million plus contracts for both Azure and Microsoft 365. Commercial remaining performance obligation, increased 18% to $212 billion, and roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 15% year-over-year. The remaining portion, which will be recognized beyond the next 12 months increased 20% and this quarter, our annuity mix was 96%. FX did not have a significant impact on our results and was roughly in line with our expectations on total company revenue, segment-level revenue, COGS, and operating expense growth. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $31.8 billion and grew 24% and 23% in constant currency, ahead of expectations. Microsoft Cloud's gross margin percentage increased slightly year-over-year to 73%, a point better than expected, primarily driven by improvements in Azure. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, Microsoft Cloud's gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points, driven by the improvement just mentioned in Azure as well as Office 365, partially offset by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. Company gross margin dollars increased 16% and 15% in constant currency and gross margin percentage increased year-over-year to 71%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, the gross margin percentage increased roughly 3 points, driven by the improvement in Azure and Office 365 as well as sales mix shift to higher margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 1%, lower than expected due to cost-efficiency focus as well as investments that shifted to future quarters. Operating expense growth was driven by marketing, LinkedIn, and cloud engineering, partially offset by devices. At a total company level, headcount at the end of September was 7% lower than a year ago. Operating income increased 25% and 24% in constant currency. Operating margins increased roughly 5 points year-over-year to 48%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins increased roughly 6 six points, driven by improved operating leverage through cost management and the higher gross margin noted earlier. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $18.6 billion and grew 13% and 12% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected results in Office 365 Commercial and LinkedIn. Office Commercial revenue grew 15% and 14% in constant currency. Office 365 Commercial revenue increased 18% and 17% in constant currency, slightly better than expected with a bit more in-period revenue recognition, while billings remained relatively in line with expectations. Growth continues to be driven by healthy renewal execution and ARPU growth, as E5 momentum remains strong. Paid Office 365 Commercial seats grew 10% year-over-year, with installed-base expansion across all customer segments. Seat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings with continued impact from the growth trends in new standalone business noted earlier. Office Commercial licensing declined 17%, in line with the continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Office Consumer revenue increased 3% and 4% in constant currency with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 18% to 76.7 million. LinkedIn revenue increased 8%, ahead of expectations, driven by slightly better-than-expected performance across all businesses. Growth was driven by Talent Solutions, though we continue to see negative year-over-year bookings there from the weaker hiring environment in key verticals. Dynamics revenue, grew 22% and 21% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 28% and 26% in constant currency with continued growth across all workloads. Segment gross margin dollars increased 13% and gross margin percentage increased slightly year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly, 1 point, driven by improvements in Office 365. Operating expenses increased to 2% and operating income increased 20% and 19% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $24.3 billion, increasing 19% and ahead of expectations, with better-than-expected results across all businesses. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue grew 21%. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 29% and 28% in constant currency, including roughly 3 points from AI Services. While the trends from prior quarter continued, growth was ahead of expectations, primarily driven by increased GPU capacity and better-than-expected GPU utilization of our AI services, as well as slightly higher-than-expected growth in our per-user business. In our per user business, the enterprise mobility and security installed base, grew 11% to over 259 million seats with continued impact from the growth trends in new standalone business noted earlier. In our on-premises server business, revenue increased 2% ahead of expectations, driven primarily by demand in advance of Windows Server 2012 end of support. Enterprise and partner services revenue increased 1% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency ahead of expectations, driven by a better-than-expected performance in Enterprise Support Services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 20% and 19% in constant currency and gross margin percentage increased slightly. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points, driven by the improvement in Azure noted earlier, even as we scale our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. Operating expenses increased 2% and 1% in constant currency, operating income grew 31% and 30% in constant currency. Now to More Personal Computing, revenue was $13.7 billion, increasing 3% and 2% in constant currency, above expectations, with better-than-expected results across all businesses. Windows OEM revenue increased 4% year-over-year, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by stronger-than-expected consumer channel inventory builds and the stabilizing PC market demand noted earlier, particularly in commercial. Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 8%, driven by demand for Microsoft 365 E5. Devices revenue decreased 22%, ahead of expectations due to stronger execution in the commercial segment. Search and news advertising revenue, ex-TAC increased 10% and 9% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations. We saw increased engagement on Bing and Edge share gains again this quarter, although search revenue growth continues to be impacted by a third-party partnership. And in gaming, revenue increased 9% and 8% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected subscriber growth in Xbox Game Pass as well as first-party content, primarily due to the Starfield launch. Xbox content and services revenue increased 13% and 12% in constant currency and Xbox hardware revenue declined 7% and 8% in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars increased 13% and 12% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased roughly 5 points year-over-year, driven primarily by sales mix-shift to higher-margin businesses. Operating expenses declined 1% and operating income increased 23% and 22% in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases were $11.2 billion to support cloud demand, including investments to scale our AI infrastructure. Cash paid for PP&E was $9.9 billion. Cash flow from operations was $30.6 billion, up 32% year-over-year, driven by strong cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $20.7 billion, up 22% year-over-year. This quarter, other income and expense was $389 million, higher-than-anticipated, driven by interest income, partially offset by net losses on investments and foreign currency remeasurement. Our effective tax rate was approximately 18%. And finally, we returned $9.1 billion to shareholders, through share repurchases and dividends. Now moving to our Q2 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise is on a U.S. dollar basis. The Activision acquisition closed on October 13. So my commentary includes the net impact of the deal from the date of acquisition. Our outlook includes purchase accounting impact, integration, and transaction-related expenses based on our current understanding of the purchase price allocation and related deal accounting. The net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from our prior relationship as a third-party partner to first party. Now to FX. Based on current rates, we expect FX to increase total revenue and segment-level revenue growth by approximately 1 point. We expect FX to have no impact to COGS and operating expense growth. In commercial bookings, we expect consistent execution across our core annuity sales motions, including healthy renewals. The growth will be impacted by a low growth expiry base. Therefore, we expect bookings growth to be relatively flat. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage to be relatively flat year-over-year, excluding the impact from the accounting estimate change, Q2 Cloud gross margin percentage will be up roughly 1 point, primarily driven by improvement in Azure and Office 365, partially offset by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. We expect capital expenditures to increase sequentially on a dollar basis, driven by investments in our cloud and AI infrastructure. As a reminder, there can be normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure buildout. Next to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 11% and 12% or $18.8 billion to $19.1 billion. Growth in constant currency will be approximately 1 point lower. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be up roughly 16% in constant currency. We're excited for Microsoft 365 Copilot general availability on November 1st, and expect the related revenue to grow gradually over time. In our on-premise business, we expect revenue to decline in the mid-to-high teens. In Office Consumer, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single-digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single-digits, driven by Talent Solutions and Marketing Solutions. Growth continues to be impacted by the overall market environment for recruiting and advertising, especially in the technology industry, where we have significant exposure. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the high teens, driven by Dynamics 365. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 17% and 18% or $25.1 billion to $25.4 billion. Revenue growth in constant currency will be approximately 1 point lower. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which as a reminder can have quarterly variability, primarily from our per-user business and from in-period revenue recognition, depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect revenue growth to be 26% to 27% in constant currency, with an increasing contribution from AI. Growth continues to be driven by Azure consumption business and we expect the trends from Q1 to continue into Q2. Our per user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect continued moderation in seat growth rates, given the size of the installed base. For H2, assuming the optimization and new workload trends continue and with the growing contribution from AI, we expect Azure revenue growth in constant currency to remain roughly stable compared to Q2. And our on-premises server business, we expect revenue growth to be roughly flat with continued hybrid demand, particularly from licenses running in multi-cloud environments. And in enterprise and partner services, revenue should decline by low-to-mid single digits. Now to more Personal Computing, which includes the net impact from the Activision acquisition. We expect revenue of $16.5 billion to $16.9 billion. Windows OEM revenue growth should be mid-to-high single digits with PC market unit volumes expected to look roughly similar to Q1. In devices, revenue should decline in the mid-teens as we continue to focus on our higher-margin premium products. In Windows Commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive revenue growth in the low-to-mid teens. Search and news advertising ex-TAC revenue growth should be mid-single digits with roughly 4 points of negative impact from a third-party partnership. Growth should be driven by volume strength, supported by Edge browser share gains and increasing Bing engagement, as we expect the advertising spend environment to be similar to Q1. A reminder that this ex-TAC growth will be roughly 4 points higher than overall search and news advertising revenue. And in gaming, we expect revenue growth in the mid-to-high 40s. This includes roughly 35 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition, which as a reminder includes adjusting for the third-party to first-party content change noted earlier. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the mid-to-high 50s, driven by roughly 50 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS between $19.4 billion to $19.6 billion, including approximately $500 million of amortization of acquired intangible assets from the Activision acquisition. We expect operating expense of $15.5 billion to $15.6 billion, including approximately $400 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related cost from the Activision acquisition. Other income and expense should be roughly negative $500 million, as interest income will be more than offset by interest expense, primarily due to a reduction in our investment portfolio balance and the issuance of short-term debt, both for the Activision acquisition. As a reminder, we are required to recognize gains or losses on our equity investments, which can increase quarterly volatility. We expect our Q2 effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. Now, some additional thoughts on H2 as well as the full fiscal year. First, FX, assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to have no meaningful impact to full year revenue COGS or operating expense growth. Therefore, in H2, we expect FX to decrease revenue COGS and operating expense growth by 1 point. Second, Activision, we expect approximately $900 million for purchase accounting adjustments as well as integration and transaction-related costs in each quarter in H2. For a full FY '24, we remain committed to investing for the cloud and AI opportunity, while also maintaining our disciplined focus on operating leverage. Therefore, as we add the net impact of Activision, inclusive of purchase accounting adjustments as well as integration and transaction-related expenses, we continue to expect full year operating margins to remain flat year-over-year. In closing, with our strong start to FY '24, I am confident that as a team, we will continue to deliver healthy growth in the year ahead, driven by our leadership in commercial cloud and our commitment to lead the AI platform wave. With that. Let's go to Q&A, Brett.
Brett Iversen: Thanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request the participants, please ask only one question. Joe, can you please repeat your instructions?
Operator: Yes. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Keith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you for taking the question and very nice quarter. The pace of innovation you guys have been putting out has been pretty amazing. And the new products garnering traction probably faster than we've expected on our side of the equation. But we're also working in an overall spending environment, that remains volatile, and I think investors are getting more concerned on it. So two questions on this, one, based on sort of the new products and the innovation, do you think you guys can sustain the type of commercial growth that we saw in Q1 as we go through the year or is the environment too tricky for that? And then when it relates to investment, Amy, you've been able to keep overall OpEx growth very low, and it was very low this quarter. At some point, should we be thinking about a return to a more aggressive investment behind all this product innovation?
Satya Nadella: Maybe I can start, Keith, and Amy you can add to it. Overall there are multiple things, Keith, they're all happening obviously simultaneously. If you just take Azure and try to characterize, where's the growth for Azure coming from or what sort of drivers for Azure numbers, there are three things all happening in parallel. Like, for example, take cloud migrations. A good reminder of where we are and even the core cloud migration story is the new Oracle announcement. Once we announced that the Oracle databases are going to be available on Azure, we saw a bunch of unlock from new customers who have significant Oracle estates that have not yet moved to the cloud because they needed to rendezvous with the rest of the app estate in one single cloud. And so we're excited about that. So in some sense, even the financial services sector, for example, is a good place where there's a lot of Oracle that still needs to move to the cloud. The second thing, of course, is the workloads start, then workloads get optimized, and then new workloads start, and that cycle continues. We'll lap some of those optimization cycles that were fairly extreme perhaps in the second half of our fiscal. And the third thing is, for us, that's unique and different is new workload starts around AI. Given our leadership position, we are seeing complete new projects start, which are AI projects. And as you know, AI projects are not just about AI meters, they have lots of other cloud meters as well. So that sort of gives you one side of what's happening in terms of enterprise. The other piece is on the SaaS side, obviously, again, this is a new product that's going to go through the enterprise adoption cycle. The results around productivity, which we demonstrated with GitHub Copilot, is what's giving us good confidence and our customers, more importantly, good confidence around what these products represent in terms of value. And so we are in the very early innings there, and so we look forward to seeing the traction for these products going forward.
Amy Hood: Keith, maybe just a few things to add and then I'll talk a little bit about the operating leverage, which is the second part of your question. In general, we saw very consistent execution from Q4 to Q1, and that's what we're talking about into Q2. I think that speaks to our value prop, which is where Satya went. It speaks to making sure that customers are getting a very quick return on value, real productivity improvement, real savings, so that when we're asking at renewal or talking about E5 upgrades or talking about AI services, that those come with real promises of high-value scenarios. And so I think that is an important piece as you think about, stability and commercial demand. And then if you think about the nature of your question, it was partially why I talked about in my full-year guidance that, now, even with the addition of Activision and purchase accounting impacts, and integration impacts, we still feel confident we can deliver consistent operating margins to last year. And it speaks to, I think, some of the improvements, we're making in Azure and even in Microsoft 365 gross margins, even in the core of the commercial cloud. It speaks to the pace at which we are delivering AI revenue with the increasing cost expense and capital investment ahead with the demand we see. And, although you're right, our operating expense comparables in H2 get more challenging than in H1, we're really focused on making sure that every dollar we put and commit is back to the priorities we talked about, which is commercial cloud leadership and leading the AI wave. And so I think that focus is really helping on both execution and leverage.
Keith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you, guys.
Brett Iversen: Thanks, Keith. Joe, next question, please.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.
Mark Moerdler: Thank you very much and congratulations on a really strong quarter. AI has been far stronger than expected, beat your guidance for Azure this quarter. And while you discussed higher utilization and more GPUs have helped, has the fact that Microsoft has a full AI devstack Copilot reference architecture and plugin architecture bidding a meaningful factor, not just from a revenue perspective, but also even potentially from a margin perspective? In addition, can you give us any color on whether Azure GPU is predominantly model training or are we seeing a lot of inferencing yet from clients? Thanks.
Satya Nadella: No. Thank you for the question, Mark. Yeah, it is true that we have -- the approach we have taken is a full stack approach all the way from whether it's ChatGPT or Bing Chat or all our Copilots, all share the same model. So in some sense, one of the things that we do have is very, very high leverage of the one model that we used -- which we trained, and then the one model that we are doing inferencing at scale. And that advantage sort of trickles down all the way to both utilization internally, utilization of third parties, and also over time, you can see the sort of stack optimization all the way to the silicon because the abstraction layer to which the developers are riding is much higher up than low-level kernels if you will. So, therefore, I think there is a fundamental approach we took, which was a technical approach of saying we'll have Copilots and Copilot stack all available. That doesn't mean we don't have people doing training for open source models or proprietary models. We also have a bunch of open source models. We have a bunch of fine-tuning happening, a bunch of RLHF happening. So there's all kinds of ways people use it. But the thing is, we have scale leverage of one large model that was trained and one large model that's being used for inference across all our first-party SaaS apps, as well as our API in our Azure AI service…
Amy Hood: And the reason, Mark, that's important is that it means, even beyond the point Satya made is that, when it comes to our ability to leverage the infrastructure that we're building out, we don't really have a preference in terms of how people are utilizing that infrastructure, whether it's through all the means that Satya mentioned. It gives us a good opportunity to see quick conversion into revenue.
Satya Nadella: Yeah. I mean, one other thing I'd just add to perhaps Mark's question as well as Keith's is, this platform transition, I think is very important for us to be very disciplined on both. I'll call our tech stack as well as our capital spend all to be concentrated. The lesson learned from the cloud side is -- we're not running a conglomerate of different businesses, it's all one tech stack up and down Microsoft's portfolio, and that, I think, is going to be very important because that discipline, given what the spend like -- it will look like for this AI transition any business that's not disciplined about their capital spend accruing across all their businesses could run into trouble.
Mark Moerdler: Extremely helpful. Thank you so much.
Brett Iversen: Thanks, Mark. Joe, next question, please.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed.
Brent Thill: Thanks, Amy. Good to see the 12% growth. Many investors are asking, can you sustain double-digit growth, especially with a stronger AI boost coming in the next several quarters?
Amy Hood: I think looking at our -- as I said, Q1 was a strong start to the year, Q2 certainly implies that. We've talked about stability for Azure into the second half of the year looking at and in line with what we're seeing for Q2. And so I think we feel good about our ability to execute, but more importantly, our ability to continue to take share.
Brett Iversen: Thanks, Brent. Joe, next question, please.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed.
Raimo Lenschow: Hey. Thank you. You sound very optimistic about the opportunity in the office space with Copilot coming out now very soon. Can you speak a little bit about -- what you're seeing in the customer base that tested this already in terms of how excited they were -- the special features there, and what does it mean in terms of adoption curve for that going forward once you go GA on 1st of November? Thank you.
Satya Nadella: No. Thanks. The question, Ramo, the good news is two-fold, one is the fact that, what is 40% of the Fortune 100 are already in the preview and are using the product and I think you all have also done lots of checks and the feedback is very, very positive. And, in fact, the interesting thing is, it's not any one tool, right? Which is the feedback even sort of is very clear that it's the all up. You just keep hitting the Copilot button across every surface, right, whether it's in Word to create documents, in Excel to, do analysis, or PowerPoint or Outlook or Teams just like that. Clearly, the Teams meeting, which is an intelligent recap, it's not just a dumb transcript. It's like having a knowledge base of all your meetings that you can query and add to essentially the knowledge terms of your enterprise. And so we are seeing broad usage across and the interesting thing is, by different functions, whether it's in finance or in sales by roles, we are seeing productivity gains like we saw with developers and GitHub Copilot. So that's the data. We are very excited about our Ignite conference, where we will talk a lot more about all of the use cases and what's -- where's the value and give more prescriptive guidance on how people can deploy. But so far so good, as far as the data is and the feedback is. And of course, this is an enterprise product, I mean, at the end of the day, we are grounded on enterprise cycle times in terms of adoption and ramp, and it's incrementally priced, so, therefore that all will apply still. But at least for something completely new to have this level of usage already and this level of excitement is something we're very, very pleased with.
Raimo Lenschow: Thank you.
Brett Iversen: Thanks, Raimo. Joe, next question, please.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed.
Karl Keirstead: Okay. Great. Thanks, Amy. Congrats on the 28% constant currency Azure growth, that's terrific. I wanted to press you a little bit on the outlook for Azure. You're obviously guiding to a 1 to 2 point decel in December and then stable thereafter. But why would it be stable? Why wouldn't it accelerate in the -- in the second half of your fiscal year, if the AI contribution is increasing as you bring on more GPU capacity? Is this a function of perhaps continued Core ex-AI Azure spend optimization, continuing or maybe even getting slightly worse? Why couldn't we see some upside in that Azure number? I know you're trying to be conservative, but I'd just love to understand it? Thanks so much.
Amy Hood: Thanks, Karl. A couple of things. As I talked about Q2 and then into H2. We've been very consistent that the optimization trends have been consistent for us through a couple of quarters now. Customers are going to continue to do that. It's an important part of running workloads that is not new. There obviously were some quarters where it was more accelerated, but that is a pattern that is and has been a fundamental part of having customers, both make new room for new workload adoption and continue to build new capabilities. And so I think that impact remains through the rest of the year, and my view is unchanged on that. And then of course, I think the key component has always been new workload starts. And at the scale we're talking about, being able to have stability in our Azure business, does mean that we will have a lot of new workload starts. And primarily we're expecting those to come from AI workloads. But AI workloads don't just use our AI services. They use data services and they use other things. And so that combination, I think, looking on a competitive basis, we feel good about our execution, we feel good about taking share and we feel good about consistent trends. And so I feel good about that guide and what it says about where we are on share.
Karl Keirstead: Okay. Terrific. Thanks.
Brett Iversen: Thanks, Karl. Joe, next question, please.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please proceed.
Bradley Sills: Wonderful. Thanks so much. Very impressive to see the Office 365 commercial seat growth hanging in here in that double digit range. It's very impressive just given the scale of that business. We think of Office as having such a dominant market position. Curious, how you think about the -- where that seat is coming from and how many more of those seats are out there to go get?
Amy Hood: Thanks for that question, and maybe I'll take that Satya if you -- if you want to add. In general, our seat growth has -- it does come from all segments, but with particular strength in small and mid-sized businesses, as well as what we call the frontline worker opportunity. And that has been, I would say, looking back a number of quarters where the majority of our seat growth has gone. And while obviously, it slowed a bit to your point, I think the fact that we're still able to add seats at this level speaks to the broadening nature of what Microsoft 365 needs. It's more applicable to more people. And so I think many people have thought, oh my goodness, you've got a lot of customers already. And we look and say, how many people when you expand what Microsoft 365 means, whether it's the security or it means analytics or it means Teams, it means lots of things in an expanding definition. It applies to more types of workers. And frankly, the value is such, especially on the small business front, where it's to the point where I think people feel like it's a great way to spend even the spend money they have is -- this remains a pretty compelling offer.
Bradley Sills: Thank you.
Brett Iversen: Thanks, Brad. Joe, next question, please.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. Please proceed.
Brent Bracelin: Thank you. Good afternoon. One thing that really stood out to me was the intelligent cloud segment operating margins. These came in, I think, at the highest level in six years, despite elevated AI investments. Was there a one-time tailwind here that helped? Or are you at the point where Azure has got economies of scale, where Microsoft could sustain high margins even with an ambitious AI investment cycle?
Amy Hood: You think -- thanks for that question. I think there are a couple things going on and I do -- I would say in particular, this was a very good leverage quarter in that segment. Number one, the Azure revenue growth and the stability we're seeing in it, absolutely is that help the operating leverage. The second component of that is in our core Azure business. The team continues to deliver thoughtful gross margin improvement across both technical decisions, software implementations. Our teams on the infrastructure build side have done really good work to deliver that, and so that's been helpful as well. And then, of course, on operating expenses, there's been a good focus on continuing even within that segment, to make sure we're focusing that work on leading in the AI transition with Azure. And so you're right, even as we're investing in AI infrastructure, which will and should show up as revenue, it'll also show up in COGS and still deliver good margin. But this does have a slightly -- as I talked about earlier, easier comp in Q1 and Q2, given it was some of our highest growth operating expense quarters in our company's history a year ago.
Brent Bracelin: Makes sense. Thank you.
Brett Iversen: Thanks, Brent. Joe, we have time for one last question.
Operator: Our last question will come from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. Please proceed.
Gregg Moskowitz: Okay. Thank you very much for taking the question. And maybe just a follow-up to what Brent was just asking about, but on the gross margin line. Amy, the Microsoft cloud gross margin is up 2 points year-over-year, excluding the useful life change, a little more improvement than we've seen in some time and some investors were worried that it might go in the other direction, given increased AI investments. And so, as you look forward, do you think that you could drive some continued gross margin improvement over the medium term and even as higher CapEx will filter into the model? Thanks.
Amy Hood: Yeah. Let me break that into two components, because they're both important and it's a really good question, Gregg. On our core business, the core Azure business, the core Office 365, M365 business, Dynamics business, they're -- they continue to deliver gross margin year-over-year improvements in the core. And so that, like in other quarters has helped this quarter. In addition, what Satya mentioned earlier in a question, and I just want to take every chance to reiterate it, if you have a consistent infrastructure from the platform all the way up through its layers, then every capital dollar we spend, if we optimize revenue against it, we will have great leverage, because wherever demand shows up in the layers, whether it's at the SaaS layer, whether it's at the infrastructure layer, whether it's for training workloads, we're able to quickly put our infrastructure to work generating revenue, or on our Bing workloads. I mean, I should have mentioned all the consumer workloads use the same frame. And so when you think about our investment in AI, yes, it will -- because we're committed to leading this wave and see demand, you will see that impact in COGS growth. But what we're committed to doing is making sure it's highly leveraged and making sure you see the same growth in revenue. And I think on occasion, you may see something pick up 1 or 2 points and the other one not quite get there, but the point is, it's going to be very well paired because of the choices we've made over the past, frankly, numerous years, to get to a point where that infrastructure is consistent.
Satya Nadella: And I'll just add that it'll be very well paired at the company level. I realize all of you care a lot about each one of our segments and each one of our KPIs, and I do too, but at the end of the day, our stack and the way it works, the way we do our capital allocation, the way we think about even the optimization of the demand to utilization is across the entirety of all of our segments and all of our products.
Gregg Moskowitz: Very helpful. Thanks.
Brett Iversen: Thanks, Gregg. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for join us today and we look-forward to speaking with all of you soon.
Amy Hood: Thank you.
Satya Nadella: Thank you.

More detailed outlook slides will be available on the Microsoft Investor Relations website, when we provide outlook commentary on today's call. Microsoft, completed the acquisition of Activision Blizzard this quarter and we are reporting its results in our More Personal Computing segment, beginning on October 13, 2023. Accordingly, our Xbox content and services revenue growth investor metric includes the net impact of Activision. Additionally, our press release and slide deck contains supplemental information regarding the net impact of the Activision acquisition on our financial results. On this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP items. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's second-quarter performance in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results. All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are the same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rate only. We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question. It will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript, and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website. During this call, we'll be making forward-looking statements which are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.
Satya Nadella: Thank you, Brett. It was a record quarter driven by the continued strength of Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $33 billion in revenue, up 24%. We’ve moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale by infusing AI across every layer of our tech stack, we are winning new customers and helping drive new benefits and productivity gains. Now I'll highlight examples of our momentum and progress starting with Azure. Azure again took share this quarter with our AI advantage. Azure offers the top performance for AI training and inference in the most diverse selection of AI accelerators, including the latest from AMD and NVIDIA, as well as our own first-party silicon Azure Maia. And with Azure AI, we provide access to the best selection of foundation and open-source models, including both LLM and SLMs, all integrated deeply with infrastructure, data, and tools on Azure. We now have 53,000 Azure AI customers, over one-third are new to Azure over the past 12 months. Our new models of service offering makes it easy for developers to use LLM's from our partners like Cohere, Meta, and Mistral on Azure, without having to manage underlying infrastructure. We have also built the world's most popular SLMs, which offer performance comparable to larger models, but are small enough to run on a laptop or mobile device. Anker, Ashley, AT&T, EY, and Thomson Reuters, for example, are all already exploring how to use our SLM-5 for their applications. And we have great momentum with Azure OpenAI Service. This quarter we added support for OpenAI's latest models including GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4 with Vision, DALL-E 3 as well as fine-tuning. We are seeing increased usage from AI-first start-ups like Moveworks, Perplexity, SymphonyAI, as well as some of the world's largest companies. Over half of the Fortune 500 use Azure OpenAI today including Ally Financial, Coca-Cola, and Rockwell Automation. For example, at CES this month, Walmart shared how it's using Azure OpenAI Service along with its own proprietary data and models to streamline how more than 50,000 associates work and transform how it's millions of customers’ shop. More broadly, customers continue to choose Azure to simplify and accelerate their cloud migrations. Overall, we are seeing larger and more strategic Azure deals with an increase in the number of $1 billion-plus Azure commitments. Vodafone, for example, will invest $1.5 billion in Cloud and AI services over the next 10 years as it works to transform the digital experience of more than 300 million customers worldwide. Now on to data. We are integrating the power of AI across the entire data stack. Our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform brings together operational databases, analytics, governance, and AI to help organizations simplify and consolidate their data estates. Cosmos DB is the go-to database to build AI-powered apps at any scale powering workloads for companies in every industry from AXA and Kohl's to Mitsubishi and TomTom. KPMG, for example, has used Cosmos DB including its built-in native vector search capabilities along with Azure OpenAI service to power an AI assistant, which it credits with driving an up to 50% increase in productivity for its consultants. All-up, Cosmos DB data transactions increased 42% year-over-year and for those organizations who want to go beyond in-database vector search, Azure AI search offers the best hybrid search solution. OpenAI is using it for retrieval augmented generation as part of ChatGPT. And this quarter, we made Microsoft Fabric generally available, helping customers like Milliman and PwC go from data to insights to action, all within the same unified SaaS solution. Data stored in Fabric's multi-cloud data lake, OneLake increased 46% quarter-over-quarter. Now on to developers. From GitHub to Visual Studio, we have the most comprehensive and loved developer tools for the era of AI. GitHub revenue accelerated to over 40% year-over-year, driven by all-up platform growth and adoption of GitHub Copilot, the world's most widely deployed AI developer tool. We now have over 1.3 million paid GitHub copilot subscribers, up 30% quarter-over-quarter, and more than 50,000 organizations use GitHub Copilot business to supercharge the productivity of their developers from digital natives like Etsy and HelloFresh to leading enterprises like Autodesk, Dell Technologies, and Goldman Sachs. Accenture alone will rollout GitHub Copilot to 50,000 of its developers this year and we're going further making copilot ubiquitous across the entire GitHub platform and new AI-powered security features, as well as Copilot enterprise, which tailors Copilot to organization's code bases and allows developers to converse with it in natural language. We're also the leader in low-code no-code development helping everyone create apps, automate workflows, analyze data, and now build custom copilots. More than 230,000 organizations have already used AI capabilities in Power Platform, up over 80% quarter-over-quarter, and with Copilot Studio, organizations can tailor Copilot for Microsoft 365 or create their own custom copilots. It is already being used by over 10,000 organizations including An Post, Holland America, PG&E. In just weeks, for example, both PayPal and Tata Digital built copilots to answer common employee queries, increasing productivity and reducing support costs. We're also using this AI moment to redefine our role in business applications. Dynamics 365 once again took share as organizations use our AI-powered apps to transform their marketing, sales, service, finance, and supply-chain functions. And we are expanding our TAM by integrating Copilot into third-party systems too. In sales out Copilot has helped sellers at more than 30,000 organizations including Lumen Technologies and Schneider Electric to enrich their customer interactions using data from Dynamics 365 or Salesforce. And with our new Copilot for service employees at companies like Northern Trust can resolve client queries faster. It includes out-of-the-box integrations to apps like Salesforce, ServiceNow, and Zendesk. With our industry and cross-industry clouds, we're tailoring our solutions to meet the needs of specific industries. In healthcare, DAX Copilot is being used by more than 100 healthcare systems including Lifespan, UNC Health and UPMC to increase physician productivity and reduce burnout. And our Cloud for Retail was front and center at NRF with retailers from Canadian Tire Corporation, to Leatherman and Ralph Lauren sharing how they will use our solutions across the shopper journey to accelerate time to value. Now on to future of work. A growing body of evidence makes clear the role AI will play in transforming work. Our own research as well as external studies show as much as 70% improvement in productivity, using generative AI for specific work tasks. And overall early Copilot for Microsoft 365 users were 29% faster in a series of tasks like searching, writing, and summarizing. Two months in, we have seen faster adoption than either our E3 or E5 suites as enterprises like Dentsu, Honda, Pfizer, all deploy Copilot to their employees. And we are expanding availability to organizations of all sizes. We're also seeing a Copilot ecosystem begin to emerge. ISVs like Atlassian, Mural, and Trello, as well as customers like Air India, Bayer, and Siemens have all built plug-ins for specific lines of business that extend Copilot's capabilities. When it comes to Teams, we again saw record usage as organizations brought together collaboration chat, meetings, and calling on one platform and Teams has also become a new entry point for us. More than two-thirds of our enterprise Teams customers buy Phone, Rooms or Premium. All this innovation is driving growth across Microsoft 365. We now have more than 400 million paid Office 365 seats and organizations like BP, Elanco, ING Bank, Mediaset, WTW, all chose E5 this quarter to empower their employees with our best-in-class productivity apps along with advanced security compliance, voice, and analytics. Now on to Windows. In 2024, AI will become a first-class part of every PC. Windows PCs with built-in neural processing units were front and center at CES, unlocking new AI experiences to make what you do on your PC easier and faster from searching for answers and summarizing emails to optimizing performance and battery efficiency. Copilot in Windows is already available on more than 75 million Windows 10 and Windows 11 PCs and with our new Copilot key, the first significant change to the Windows keyboard in 30 years, we're providing one-click access. We also continue to transform how Windows is experienced and managed with Azure Virtual Desktop and Windows 365, introducing new features that make it simpler for employees to access and IT teams to secure their cloud PCs. Usage of cloud-delivered Windows increased over 50% year-over-year. And all-up, Windows 11 commercial deployments increased 2 times year-over-year as companies like HPE and Petrobras rolled out operating systems to employees. Now onto security. The recent security attacks, including the nation-state attack on our corporate systems, we reported a week and a half ago have highlighted the urgent need for organizations to move even faster to protect themselves from cyber threats. It's why last fall we announced a set of engineering priorities under our secure future initiative, bringing together every part of the company to advance cyber security protection across both new products and legacy infrastructure. And it's why we continue to innovate across our security portfolio as well as our operational security posture to help customers adopt a Zero Trust security architecture. Our industry-first unified security operations platform brings together our SIM Microsoft Sentinel, our XDR Microsoft Defender, and Copilot for security to help teams manage an increasingly complex security landscape. And with Copilot for security, we're now helping hundreds of early access customers including Cmax, Dow, LTI Mindtree, McAfee, Nucor Steel, significantly increase their SecOps team's productivity. This quarter, we extended copilot to Entra, Intune, and Purview. All-up, we have over 1 million customers, including more than 700,000 who use four or more of our security products like Arrow Electronics, DXC Technology, Freeport-McMoRan, Insight Enterprises, JB Hunt, and the Mosaic Company. Now on to LinkedIn. LinkedIn is now helping over 1 billion members learn, sell, and get hired. We continue to see strong global membership growth driven by member sign-ups in key markets like Germany and India. In an ever-changing job market, members are staying competitive through skill-building and knowledge-sharing. Over the last 12 months, members have added 680 million skills to their profiles, up 80% year-over-year. Our new AI-powered features are transforming the LinkedIn member experience, everything from how people learn new skills to how they search for jobs and engage with [indiscernible]. New AI features, including more personalized emails also continue to increase business ROI on the platform and our hiring business took share for the sixth consecutive quarter. And more broadly, AI is transforming our search and browser experience. We are encouraged by the momentum, earlier this month, we achieved a new milestone with 5 billion images created and 5 billion chats conducted to-date, both doubling quarter-over-quarter and both being an edge took share this quarter. We also introduced Copilot as a standalone destination across all browsers and devices, as well as a Copilot app on iOS and Android. And just two weeks ago, we introduced Copilot Pro providing access to the latest models for quick answers and high-quality image creation and access to Copilot for Microsoft 365 personal and family subscribers. Now on to gaming. This quarter we set all-time records for monthly active users in Xbox PC, as well as mobile, where we now have over 200 million monthly active users alone, inclusive of Activision Blizzard King. With our acquisition, we have added hundreds of millions of gamers to our ecosystem, as we execute on our ambition to reach more gamers on more platforms. With cloud gaming, we continue to innovate to offer players more ways to experience the games they love where and when and how they want, hours streamed increased 44% year-over-year. Great content is key to our growth and across our portfolio, I've never been more excited about our line-up of upcoming games. Earlier this month, we shared exciting new first-party titles coming this year to Xbox PC and Game Pass including Indiana Jones. And we've also announced launching significant updates this calendar year to many of our most durable franchises, which brings in millions of players each month, including Call of Duty, Elder Scrolls Online, and Starfield. In closing, we are looking forward to how AI-driven transformation will benefit people and organizations in 2024. With that, I'll hand it over to Amy.
Amy Hood: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $62 billion, up 18% and 16% in constant currency. When adjusted for the prior year's Q2 charge, operating income increased 25% and 23% in constant currency, and earnings per share was $2.93, which increased 26% and 23% in constant currency. Results exceeded expectations and we delivered another quarter of double-digit top and bottom-line growth. Strong execution by our sales teams and partners drove share gains again this quarter across many of our businesses, as Satya referenced. In our commercial business, strong demand for our Microsoft cloud offerings, including AI services drove better-than-expected growth and large long-term Azure contracts. Microsoft 365 suite strength contributed to ARPU expansion for our office commercial business, while new business growth continued to be moderated for standalone products sold outside the Microsoft 365 suite. Commercial bookings were ahead of expectations and increased 17% and 9% in constant currency on a low expiry base. The strength in long-term Azure contracts mentioned earlier, along with strong execution across our core annuity sales motions, including healthy renewals drove our results. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 17% and 16% in constant currency to $222 billion, roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 15% year-over-year. The remaining portion recognized beyond the next 12 months increased 19%. And this quarter, our annuity mix was 96%. In our consumer business, the PC and advertising markets were generally in line with our expectations. PC market volumes continued to stabilize at pre-pandemic levels [Technical Difficulty] Gaming console market was a bit smaller. As a reminder, my Q2 commentary includes the net impact of Activision from the date of acquisition, inclusive of purchase accounting, integration, and transaction-related expenses. The net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from our prior relationship as a third-party partner to first-party. At a company level, Activision contributed approximately 4 points to revenue growth, was a 2 point drag on adjusted operating income growth, and a negative $0.5 impact to earnings per share. This impact includes $1.1 billion from purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related costs, such as severance-related charges related to last week's announcement. FX was roughly in line with our expectations on total company revenue, segment-level revenue, COGS, and operating expense growth. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $33.7 billion, ahead of expectations, and grew 24% and 22% in constant currency. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage was 72%, relatively unchanged year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point, driven by improvement in Azure and Office 365, partially offset by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. Company gross margin dollars increased 20% and 18% in constant-currency and gross margin percentage increased year-over-year to 68%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points, even with the impact of $581 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration, and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Growth was driven by improvement in devices, as well as the improvement in Azure and Office 365 as just mentioned. Operating expenses increased 3% with 11 points from the Activision acquisition, partially offset by 7 points of favorable impact from the prior year Q2 charge. The Activision impact includes $550 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration, and transaction-related cost. At a company level, headcount at the end of December was 2% lower than a year ago. Operating margins increased roughly 5 points year-over-year to 44%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins increased roughly 6 points driven by the higher gross margin noted earlier, the favorable impact from the prior year Q2 charge, and improved operating leverage through disciplined cost control. Now, to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $19.2 billion and grew 13% and 12% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, primarily driven by better-than-expected results in LinkedIn. Office commercial revenue grew 15% and 13% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 17% and 16% in constant currency, in line with expectations, driven by healthy renewal execution and ARPU growth from continued E5 momentum. Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 9% year-over-year to over $400 million with installed base expansion across all customer segments. Seat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings, offset by the continued growth trends in new standalone business noted earlier. Office commercial licensing declined 17% and 18% in constant currency with continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Office Consumer revenue increased 5% and 4% in constant currency with continued momentum in Microsoft 355 subscriptions, which grew 16% to 78.4 million. LinkedIn revenue increased 9% and 8% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by slightly better-than-expected performance across all businesses. In our Talent Solutions business bookings growth was again impacted by weaker hiring environment in key verticals. Dynamics revenue grew 21% and 19% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 27% and 24% in constant currency with continued growth across all workloads. Bookings growth was impacted by weaker new business, primarily in Dynamics 365 ERP and CRM workloads. Segment gross margin dollars increased 14% and 12% in constant currency and gross margin percentage increased slightly year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point, primarily driven by improvement in Office 365. Operating expenses decreased 5% and 6% in constant currency, with 5 points of favorable impact from the prior-year Q2 charge. Operating income increased 26% and 24% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment, revenue was $25.9 billion, increasing 20% and 19% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, with better-than-expected results across all businesses. Overall server products and cloud services revenue grew 22% and 20% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 30% and 28% in constant-currency, including 6 points of growth from AI services. Both AI and non-AI Azure services drove our outperformance. In our per-user business, the Enterprise Mobility and Security installed base grew 11% to over 268 million seats with continued impact from the growth trends in new standalone business noted earlier. In our on-premises server business, revenue increased 3% and 2% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven primarily by the better-than-expected demand related to Windows Server 2012 end of support. Enterprise and partner services revenue increased 1% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency with better-than-expected performance across enterprise support services and industry solutions. Segment gross margin dollars increased 20% and 18% in constant currency and gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point, driven by the improvement in Azure noted earlier, partially offset by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. Operating expenses decreased 8% and 9% in constant currency, with 9 points of favorable impact from the prior year Q2 charge, operating income grew 40% and 37% in constant currency. Now, to more Personal Computing. Revenue was $16.9 billion, increasing 19% and 18% in constant currency, in line with expectations overall. Growth includes 15 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Windows OEM revenue increased 11% year-over-year, ahead of expectations, driven by slightly better performance and higher monetizing consumer markets. Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 9% and 7% in constant-currency, below expectations primarily [Technical Difficulty] period revenue recognition from the mix of contracts. Annuity billings growth remains healthy. Devices revenue decreased 9% and 10% in constant currency, ahead of expectations due to stronger execution in the commercial segment. Search and news advertising revenue ex-TAC increased 8% and 7% in constant currency, relatively in line with expectations, driven by higher search volume, offset by negative impact from a third-party partnership. And in gaming, revenue increased 49% and 48% in constant currency, with 44 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Total gaming revenue was in line with expectations of stronger-than-expected performance from Activision was offset by the weaker-than-expected console market noted earlier. Xbox content and services revenue increased 61% and 60% in constant currency, driven by 55 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Xbox hardware revenue grew 3% and 1% in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars increased 34% and 32% in constant currency with 17 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Gross margin percentage increased roughly 6 points year-over-year, driven by higher devices gross margin and sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 38% with 48 points of impact from the Activision acquisition, partially offset by 6 points of favorable impact from the prior year Q2 charge. Operating income increased 29% and 26% in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases were $11.5 billion, lower-than-expected due to delivery for a third-party capacity contract shifting from Q2 to Q3. Cash paid-for PP&E was $9.7 billion. These data center investments support our cloud demand, inclusive of needs to scale our AI infrastructure. Cash flow from operations was $18.9 billion, up 69% driven by strong cloud billings and collections on a prior year comparable that was impacted by lower operating income. Free cash flow was $9.1 billion, up 86% year-over-year, reflecting the timing of cash paid-for property and equipment. This quarter, other income and expense was in line with expectations, negative $506 million, driven by interest expense and net losses on investments, partially offset by interest income. Our effective tax rate was approximately 18%. And finally, we returned $8.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Now moving to our Q3 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise is on a US dollar basis. First FX, based on current rates, we expect FX to increase total revenue and segment-level revenue growth by less than 1 point. And we expect no impact to COGS and operating expense growth. In commercial bookings, strong execution across our core annuity sales motions, including healthy renewals along with long-term Azure commitments should drive healthy growth on a growing expiry base. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should decrease roughly 1 point year-over-year, excluding the impact from the accounting estimate change, Q3 cloud gross margin percentage will be relatively flat as improvement in Office 365 and Azure will be offset by sales mix shift to Azure, as well as the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. We expect capital expenditures to increase materially on a sequential basis, driven by investments in our cloud and AI infrastructure and the flip of a delivery date from Q2 to Q3 from a third-party provider noted earlier. As a reminder, there can be normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure build-out. Next to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue of $19.3 billion to $19.6 billion or growth between 10% and 12%. In Office Commercial revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be approximately 15% in constant currency. While it's early days for Microsoft 365 Copilot, we're excited by the adoption we've seen to date and continue to expect revenue to grow over time. In our on-premise business, we expect revenue to decline in the low 20s. In Office Consumer, we expect revenue growth in the mid-to-high single-digits, driven by Microsoft's 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the mid-to-high single digits, driven by continued growth across all businesses. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the mid-teens, driven by Dynamics 365. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue of $26 billion to $26.3 billion or growth between 18% and 19%. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability, primarily from our per-user business and from in-period revenue recognition, depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q3 revenue growth in constant currency to remain stable to our stronger-than-expected Q2 results. Growth will be driven by our Azure consumption business with continued strong contribution from AI. Our per-user business should see benefit from Microsoft 365 Suite momentum though we expect continued moderation in seat growth rates given the size of the installed base. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue growth in the low-to-mid single-digits with continued hybrid demand, including licenses running in multi-cloud environments. And in the enterprise and partner services revenue should decline approximately 10% on a high prior year comparable for enterprise support services and more Personal Computing, we expect revenue of $14.7 billion, $15.1 billion or growth between 11% and 14%. Windows OEM revenue growth should be relatively flat as PC market unit volumes continue at pre-pandemic levels. In Windows Commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our Advanced Security Solutions should drive revenue growth in the mid-teens. As a reminder, our quarterly revenue growth can have variability, primarily from in-period revenue recognition, depending on the mix of contracts. In Devices, revenue should decline in the low-double-digits as we continue to focus on our higher-margin premium products. Search and news advertising ex-TAC revenue growth should be in the mid-to-high single-digits, about 8 points higher than overall search and news advertising revenue, driven by continued volume strength. And in gaming, we expect revenue growth in the low 40s, including approximately 45 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the low-to-mid 50s, driven by approximately 50 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Hardware revenue will decline year-over-year. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS between $18.6 billion to $18.8 billion, including approximately $700 million of amortization of acquired intangible assets from the Activision acquisition. We expect operating expenses of $15.8 billion to $15.9 billion, including approximately $300 million from purchase accounting, integration, and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Other income and expenses should be roughly negative $600 million as interest income will be more than offset by interest expense and other losses. As a reminder, we are required to recognize gains or losses on our equity investments, which can increase quarterly volatility. We expect our Q3 effective tax rate to be in line with our full-year rate, which we now expect to be approximately 18%. Now, some additional thoughts on the full-fiscal year. First FX, assuming current rates remain stable, we now expect FX to increase Q4 and full-year revenue growth by less than 1 point. We continue to expect no meaningful impact to full-year COGS or operating expense growth. Second Activision. For the full-year FY 2024, we expect Activision to be accretive to operating income, when excluding purchase accounting, integration and transaction-related cost. At a total company level, we delivered strong results in H1 and demand for our Microsoft Cloud continues to drive the growth in our outlook for H2. Our commitment to scaling our cloud and AI investment is guided by customer demand and a substantial market opportunity. As we scale these investments, we remain focused on driving efficiencies across every layer of our tech stack and disciplined cost management across every team. Therefore, we expect full-year operating margins to be up 1 to 2 points year-over-year, even as AI capital investments drive COGS growth. This operating margin expansion excludes the impact from the Activision acquisition and the headwind from the change in useful lives last year. In closing, we are focused on execution. So our customers can realize the benefits of AI productivity gains as we invest to lead this AI platform wave. With that, let's go to Q&A, Brett.
Brett Iversen: Thanks Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request the participants please only ask one question. Joe, can you please repeat your instructions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.
Mark Moerdler: Thank you very much. Congratulations on the strong quarter and thanks for letting me ask the question. Amy, you've discussed Azure being stable and you deliver Azure growth stability, but if we drill in one layer, we see Azure AI [aiming] (ph) to become a bigger portion of the revenue. I understand that separating what is directly AI revenue versus other IaaS, PaaS revenue that are leveraging well driven by AI is difficult, can you help me with two related questions? Optimization has been stabilizing and at some point, it should be part of the revenue flow. How should we think about what happens then, do we see non-directly AI consumption being flattish or do we see a rebound as the cloud shift continues and the need for data of inferencing grows? Second point. On AI, where are we in the journey from training driving most of Azure AI usage to inferencing? When do you think we start to see pick-up in non-Microsoft inferencing kick in, when do you think we could hit the point where inferencing is the bigger part of the driver? Thank you.
Satya Nadella: You want me to go first and...
Amy Hood: You go first and I'll take the technical.
Satya Nadella: Yes, let me -- just on the inferencing and training, most of what you've seen for the most part is all inferencing. So, none of the large model training stuff is in any of our higher numbers at all. What small batch training, so somebody is doing fine-tuning or what have you, that will be there, but that's sort of a minor part. So, most of what you see in the Azure number is broadly inferencing. And Mark, I think it may be helpful to sort of think about, like what is the new workload in AI? The new workload in AI, obviously, in our case starts with one of the frontier -- I mean, starts with the Frontier model Azure OpenAI. But it's not just about just one model, right. So, you first -- you take that model, you do RLHF, you may do some fine-tuning, you do retrieval, which means you are sort of either heating some storage meter or you're heating some compute meters. And so to -- and by the way, you will also distil a large model to a small model and that would be a training perhaps. But that's a small batch training that uses essentially inference infrastructure. So, I think that's what's happening. So you could even say these AI workloads themselves will have a lifecycle which is they'll get rebuilt, then there'll be continuously optimized over time. So, that's sort of one-side. And I think if I understand your question, what's happening with the traditional optimization, and I think last quarter we said. One, we're going to continue to have these cycles where people will build new workloads, they will optimize the workloads and then they'll start new workloads. So I think that that's what we continue to see. But that period of massive, I'll call it, optimization only and no new workloads start, that I think has ended at this point. So what you're seeing is much more of that continuous cycles by customers, both whether it comes to AI or whether it comes to the traditional workloads.
Amy Hood: No, maybe I'll just add just a few things to that. I think whether you use the word lapping, these optimization comparables or the comparables easing, is all sort of the same thing, that we're getting to that point, in H2 that's absolutely true. We'd like to talk about the contribution of AI specifically for the reason Satya talked about, these are -- this is starting to see the application of AI at scale. And we want to be able to show people, this is how that point will work, it's inferencing workloads where people are expecting productivity gains, other benefits that grow revenue and so, I do think about those as both related. And ultimately the TAM that we go after is best sort of across both of those, both AI workload and I guess, “non-AI workload” although to Satya's point, you need all of it.
Mark Moerdler: Perfect. Thank you very much for the deep answer.
Brett Iversen: Thanks, Mark. Joe, next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed.
Brent Thill: Good afternoon. Amy, the margin improvement is pretty shocking to most considering the investments that you and Satya are putting into AI. I'm curious if you could just walk through, how this is possible and what you're seeing so far in some of the costs that you're trying to manage as you scale up AI?
Amy Hood: Thanks, Brent. First of all, thanks for the question. The teams are obviously been hard at work on this topic. We do point out that, Q2 because of the impact of the charge a year ago, you're seeing larger margin improvement than I would say, sort of a run-rate margin improvement. So, let me first say that. Secondly, the absolute margin improvement has also been very good and it speaks to, I think one of the things Satya talked about and I reiterated a bit, which is that, we want really to make sure we're making investments, we're making them in consistency across the tech stack. The tech stack we're building, no matter what team is on, is inclusive of AI enablement. And so think about as building that consistency without needing to add a lot of resources to do that. It's been a real pivot of our entire investment infrastructure to be working on this work. And I think that's important, because it means you're shifting to an AI-first position, not just in the language we use, but in what people are working on day-to-day. That does obviously create a leverage opportunity. There has also been really good work put in by many teams on improving the gross margin of the products; we talked about it with Office 365, we talked about in Azure core. We even talked about it across our devices portfolio, where we've seen material improvements over the course of the year. And so, when you kind of take improvements at the gross margin level, plus this consistency of re-pivoting our workforce toward the AI-first work we're doing, without adding material number of people to the workforce, you end up with that type of leverage. And we still need to be investing. And so, the important part, invest towards the thing that's going to shape the next decade and continue to stay focused on being able to deliver your day-to-day commitments. And so it's a great question. And hopefully, that helps piece apart a few of the components.
Brent Thill: Thanks, Amy.
Brett Iversen: Thanks, Brent. Joe next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Kash Rangan: Hi, thank you very much. A superb quarter of great improvements. Just one question for you Satya. Cloud computing changed the tech stack in ways that we could not imagine 10 years back, the nature of the database layer, the operating system layer, every layer just changed dramatically. How do you foresee generative AI changing the tech stack as we know it? Thank you so much.
Satya Nadella: Yes, I think it's going to have a very foundational impact. In fact, you could say the core compute architecture itself changes, everything from power, power density to the data center design, to what used to be the accelerator, now is the sort of the main CPU, so to speak, or the main compute unit. And so, I think in the network, the memory architecture, all of it. So as the core computer architecture changes, I think every workload changes. And so yes, so there is a full, like, take our data layer, the most exciting thing for me in the last year has been to see how our data layer has evolved to be built for AI, right? If you think about Fabric, one of the genius of Fabric is to be able to say, let's separate out storage from the compute layer. In compute we'll have traditional SQL, we’ll have Spark. And by the way, you can have an Azure AI job on top of the same data lake, so to speak, or the lakehouse pattern. And then the business model you can combine all of those different compute. So that's the type of compute architecture. So it's sort of a -- so that's just one example. The tool stuff is changing. Office, I mean if you think about what -- if I look at Copilot; Copilots extensibility with GPT, Copilot apps to the Copilot stack, that's another sort of part of what's happening to the tech stack. So yes, I mean, definitely builds. I mean. I do believe, being in the cloud has been very helpful to build AI. But now, AI is just redefining what it means to have, what the cloud looks like, both at the infrastructure level and the app model.
Kash Rangan: Terrific. Thank you so much.
Brett Iversen: Thanks, Kash. Joe, our next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed.
Karl Keirstead: Thank you. I wanted to return to AI, the six point AI lift to Azure is just extraordinary. But I wanted to ask you about your progress in standing up the infrastructure to meet that demand. If you feel like Microsoft is supply GPU-constrained. Is the success you've had maybe working through some of the scaling bottlenecks that some of the other cloud infrastructure providers have talked about, a little bit maybe on the infrastructure scaling front might be interesting. Thank you.
Amy Hood: Thanks, Karl. Maybe I'll start and Satya feel free to add on. I think we feel really good about where we have been in terms of adding capacity. You started to see the acceleration in our capital expense starting almost a year ago, and you've seen us scale through that process. And that is going toward as we talked about Servers and also new data center footprints to be able to meet what we see as this demand and really changing demand as we look forward. And so, I do feel like the team has done a very good job. I feel like, primarily obviously, this is being built by us, but we've also used third-party capacity to help when we could have that help us in terms of meeting customer demand. And I think looking forward, you'll tend to C&I guide toward it, accelerated capital expense to continue to be able to add capacity in the coming quarters, given what we see in terms of pipeline.
Brett Iversen: Thanks, Karl. Joe, next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Brad Zelnick: Great, thank you so much for taking the question. The early market feedback that we're all hearing on Microsoft 365 copilot is very powerful. Can you provide more granularity on what you're seeing in terms of adoption trends versus perhaps other new product introductions in the past, what if anything is holding it back, and how much of a priority is it to get it in the hands of customers? To what lengths might you go to incentivize just getting it out in the market? Thank you.
Satya Nadella: No, thank you for the question, Brad. So, a couple of things. In my comments I said increase in relation to our previous suites like, let's say, E3 or E5. Whatever two months in, it's definitely much faster than that. And so, from that perspective. It's exciting to see, I’d say, the demand signal, the deployment signal. I was looking at by tenant, even usage, it's faster than anything else because it's easier, right. I mean, it's sort of -- it shows up in your app, if you click on it, like any ribbon thing and it becomes a daily habit. So it in fact, it reminds me a little bit of sort of the back-in-the day of PC adoption, right. It's kind of -- I think it first starts off with few people having access. There are many companies that are doing standard issue, right. So just like PCs became standard issue at some point after PCs being adopted by early adopters. I think that's the cycle that at least we expect. In terms of what we're seeing, it's actually interesting, If you look at the data we have, summarization, that's what it's like number-one, like I'm doing summarization of Teams meetings inside of Teams, during the meeting, after the meeting, word documents summarization, I get something in email on summarizing. So summarization has become a big deal. Drafts, right, you're drafting emails, drafting documents. So, anytime you want to start something, the blank page thing goes away and you start by prompting and drafting. Chat, to me, the most powerful feature is now you have the most important database in your company, which happens to be the database of your documents and communications. It is now queryable by natural language in a powerful way, right. I can go and say, what are all the things Amy said, I should be watching out for next quarter and it will come out with great detail. And so Chat, summarization, draft, also by the way, actions. One of the most used thing is, here's the Word document, go complete, I mean, create a PowerPoint for me. So, those are the stuff that is also beginning. So, I feel like these all become -- but fundamentally, what happens is, if you remember the PC adoption cycle, what it did was work artifact and work flow changed, right. You can imagine what forecasting was before excel and email and what it was after. So similarly, you'll see work and workflow change as people summarize faster, draft regulatory submissions faster. Chat to get knowledge from your business. And so, those are the things that we are seeing as overall patterns.
Amy Hood: And maybe just to add two points. One of the exciting things as I said for some companies, it's going to be standard issue like PC, for other companies, they may want to do a land with a smaller group, see the productivity gains and then expand. And so being able to lift some of the seat requirements that we did earlier this month, it's really going to allow customers to be able to use that approach too. And the other thing I would add, we always talk about in enterprise software, you sell software, then you wait and then it gets deployed, and then after deployment, you want to see usage. And in particular, what we've seen and you would expect this, in some ways with Copilot even in the early stages, obviously, deployment happens very quickly. But really what we're seeing is engagement grow. As to Satya's point on how you learn and your behavior changes you see engagement grow with time. And so I think those are just to put a pin in that, because it's an important dynamic when we think about the optimism you hear from us.
Brad Zelnick: Excellent, thank you so much.
Brett Iversen: Thanks, Brad. Joe, next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed.
Mark Murphy: Yeah. Thank you very much. Is it possible to unpack the 6 point AI services tailwind, it's just to help us understand which elements ramped up by the three incremental points. For instance, is it more of the open AI inferencing, GitHub Copilot, other Copilots, the Azure OpenAI service, third party LLMs running on Azure. I'm just wondering, where did you see the strongest step-up in that activity?
Amy Hood: Mark, without getting into tons of line items, it's more simple to think of it as really, it's people adopting it for inferencing at the API generally. I mean that's the easiest way to think about it. And we also saw growth in GitHub Copilot which you talked -- which Satya talked about and we saw a growing number of third parties using it in some small ways for training. But this is primarily an inferencing workload right now in terms of what's driving that number. We used to think of it that way.
Satya Nadella: Azure OpenAI and then OpenAIs on APIs on top of Azure would be the sort of the major drivers. But there is a lot of the small batch training that goes on, whether it's let Jeff for fine-tuning. And then lot of people who are you starting to use models as a service with all the other new models, but it's predominantly Azure open AI today.
Mark Murphy: Thank you.
Brett Iversen: Thanks, Mark. Joe, next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. Please proceed.
Brad Reback: Great, thanks very much. Amy for many, many years in Commercial Office 365 seat growth has far outpaced ARPU and over the last couple of quarters, we're getting a convergence, obviously, as the seat count gets really large. As we look-forward, should they run even for a period of time or should we expect ARPU to outpace seat growth here in the short term? Thanks.
Amy Hood: That's a great question, Brad. Let me split apart the components. And then we can come back to whether they should equalize or just go on sort of a bit, actually believe it or not, somewhat independent trajectory and I will explain why I say that. Your seat growth as we talk about is primarily from, at this point, small and medium-size businesses and really frontline workers scenarios. And to your point on occasion, those are lower ARPU seats, but there are also -- there are new seats and so you see that in the seat count number. And as we get through and we've seen that come down a little bit quarter-over-quarter and we've guided for that really to happen again next quarter, but a very separate thing is being able to add ARPU. And traditionally, and again this quarter, right, that's come over-time from E3. Then from E5. And we're continuing to see very healthy seat momentum and you heard very good renewals. So, all of that, right, completely independent in some way from seat growth. Then the next thing, that actually we just talked about, maybe in Brad's question I'm trying to recall is that, you're going to see Copilot revenue will run there as ARPU, right. That won't show a seat growth. So you'll have E3, E5 transition, Copilot, all show-up in ARPU over time, and then you’ll have the seat growth be primarily still small business and frontline worker and maybe new industry scenarios. So, I tend to not really, Brad, think about them as related lines, believe it or not. I think about them as sort of unique Independent motions we run and there is still room for seat growth and obviously with the levers we've talked about, there's room for ARPU growth as well.
Brad Reback: That's great. Thanks very much.
Brett Iversen: Thanks, Brad. Joe we have time for one last question.
Operator: Our last question will come from the line of Tyler Radke with Citi. Please proceed.
Tyler Radke: Thanks for taking my question. Satya your enthusiasm about GitHub Copilot was noticeable on the conference call and at the AI Summit in New York last week. I'm wondering how you're thinking about pricing, obviously, this is driving pretty incredible breakthroughs and productivity for developers. But how do you think about your ability to drive ARPU on the GitHub Copilot over-time and just talk us through how you're thinking about the next phase of new releases there?
Satya Nadella: Yeah. I mean -- it's -- I always go back to sort of my own conviction that this generation of AI is going to be different, started with the move from 2.5 to 3 of GPT. And then it's use inside of developer scenario with GitHub copilot and so yes. I think this is the place where it's most evolved. In terms of its economic benefits or productivity benefits and you see it. We see it inside of Microsoft, we see it in all of the key studies we put out of customers, everybody had talked to its pick-up, but it is the one place where it's becoming standard issue for any developer is like if you takeaways spell check from Word, I'll be unemployable. And similarly, it will be like -- I think GitHub Copilot becomes core to anybody who is doing software development. The thing that you brought up is a little bit of a continuation to how Amy talked about, right. So you are going to start seeing people think of these tools as productivity enhancers, right. I mean, if I look at it, our ARPUs have been great, but they're pretty low.. You know even though we've had a lot of success, it's not like we had a high-priced ARPU company. I think what you're going to start finding is, whether it's sales copilot or service copilot or GitHub Copilot of security copilot. They are going to fundamentally capture some of the value they drive in terms of the productivity of the OpEx, right. So it's like 2 points, 3 points of OpEx leverage would be goal is on software spend. I think that's a pretty straightforward value equation. And so that's the first time, I mean this is not something we've been able to make the case for before whereas now I think we have that case. Then even the horizontal copilot is what Amy was talking about, which is at the Office 365 or Microsoft 365 level, even there, you can make the same argument whatever ARPU we may even have with E5, now, you can see incrementally as a percentage of the OpEx, how much would you pay for a copilot to give you more time savings for example. And so yes, I think all up, I do see this as a new vector for us in what I'll call the next phase of knowledge work and frontline work even in their productivity and how we participate. And I think GitHub copilot, I never thought of the tools business as fundamentally participating in the operating expenses of a company's spend on, let's say, development activity and now you're seeing that transition, it is just not tools, it's about productivity of your dev team.

Satya Nadella: Thank you, Brett. It was a record third quarter, powered by the continued strength of the Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $35 billion in revenue, up 23%. Microsoft Copilot and Copilot stack, spanning everyday productivity, business process, and developer services, to models, data, and infrastructure, are orchestrating a new era of AI transformation, driving better business outcomes across every role and industry. Now, I’ll highlight examples, walking up the stack, starting with AI infrastructure. Azure again took share, as customers use our platforms and tools to build their own AI solutions. We offer the most diverse selection of AI accelerators, including the latest from NVIDIA, AMD, as well as our own first-party silicon. Our AI innovation continues to build on our strategic partnership with OpenAI. More than 65% of the Fortune 500 now use Azure OpenAI Service. We also continue to innovate and partner broadly to bring customers the best selection of frontier models and open source models, LLMs and SLMs. With Phi-3, which we announced earlier this week, we offer the most capable and cost-effective SLM available. It’s already being trialed by companies like CallMiner, LTIMindtree, PwC, and TCS. Our Models as a Service offering makes it easy for developers to use LLMs and SLMs without having to manage any underlying infrastructure. Hundreds of paid customers, from Accenture and EY, to Schneider Electric, are using it to take advantage of API access to third-party models, including as of this quarter the latest from Cohere, Meta, and Mistral. And, as part of a partnership announced last week, G42 will run its AI applications and services on our cloud. All-up, the number of Azure AI customers continues to grow and average spend continues to increase. We also saw an acceleration of revenue from migrations to Azure. Azure Arc continues to help customers like DICK'S Sporting Goods and World Bank streamline their cloud migrations. Arc now has 33,000 customers, up over 2X year-over-year. And, we are the hyperscale platform of choice for SAP and Oracle workloads, with Conduent and Medline moving their on-premises Oracle estates to Azure, and Kyndryl and L'Oreal migrating their SAP workloads to Azure. Overall, we are seeing an acceleration in the number of large Azure deals from leaders across industries, including billion dollar plus multi-year commitments announced this month from Cloud Software Group and The Coca-Cola Company. The number of $100 million plus Azure deals increased over 80% year-over-year, while the number of $10 million plus deals more than doubled. Now, on to data and analytics. Our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform provides customers with the broadest capabilities spanning databases, analytics, business intelligence, governance, and AI. Over half of our Azure AI customers also use our data and analytics tools. Customers are building intelligent applications running on Azure, PostgreSQL and Cosmos DB with deep integrations with Azure AI. TomTom is a great example. They’ve used Cosmos DB along with Azure Open AI service to build their own immersive in-car infotainment system. We are also encouraged by our momentum with our next-generation analytics platform, Microsoft Fabric. Fabric now has over 11,000 paid customers, including leaders in every industry from ABB, EDP, Energy Transfer to Equinor, Foot Locker, ITOCHU and Lumen, and we are seeing increased usage intensity. Fabric is seamlessly integrated with Azure AI Studio, meaning customers can run models against enterprise data that’s consolidated in Fabric’s multi-cloud data lake, OneLake. And Power BI, which is also natively integrated with Fabric provides business users with AI-powered insights. We now have over 350,000 paid customers. Now on to developers. GitHub Copilot is bending the productivity curve for developers. We now have 1.8 million paid subscribers with growth accelerating to over 35% quarter-over-quarter and continues to see increased adoption from businesses in every industry, including Itau, Lufthansa Systems, Nokia, Pinterest and Volvo cars. CoPilot is driving growth across the broader GitHub platform, too. AT&T, Citi Group and Honeywell all increased their overall GitHub usage after seeing productivity and code quality increases with CoPilot. All up more than 90% of the Fortune 100 are now GitHub customers and revenue accelerated over 45% year-over-year. Anyone can be a developer with new AI-powered features across our low-code, no-code tools, which makes it easier to build an app, automate workflow or create a Copilot using natural language. 30,000 organizations, across every industry have used Copilot Studio to customize Copilot for Microsoft 365 or build their own, up 175% quarter-over-quarter. Cineplex, for example, built a Copilot for customer service agents, reducing query handling time from as much as 15 minutes to 30 seconds. All up over 330,000 organizations, including over half of Fortune 100 have used AI-powered capabilities in Power Platform, and Power Apps now has over 25 million monthly active users, up over 40% year-over-year. Now on to future of work, we are seeing AI democratize expertise across the workforce. What inventory turns are to efficiency of supply chains, knowledge turns, the creation and diffusion and knowledge are to productivity of an organization. And Copilot for Microsoft 365 is helping increase knowledge turns, thus having a cascading effect changing work, work artifacts and workflows and driving better decision-making, collaboration and efficiency. This quarter, we made Copilot available to organizations of all types and sizes from enterprises to small businesses, nearly 60% of the Fortune 500 now use Copilot and we have seen accelerated adoption across industries and geographies with companies like Amgen, BP, Cognizant, Koch Industries, Moody’s, Novo Nordisk, NVIDIA, and Tech Mahindra purchasing over 10,000 seats. We’re also seeing increased usage intensity from early adopters, including a nearly 50% increase in the number of Copilot-assisted interactions per user in Teams, bridging group activity with business process workflows and enterprise knowledge. And we’re not stopping there. We’re accelerating our innovation, adding over 150 Copilot capabilities since the start of the year. With Copilot and Dynamics 365, we are helping businesses transform every role in business function as we take share with our AI-powered apps across all categories. This quarter, we made our Copilot for Service and Copilot for Sales broadly available, helping customer service agents and sellers at companies like Land O’Lakes, Northern Trust, Rockwell Automation and Toyota Group generate role-specific insights and recommendations from across Dynamics 365 and Microsoft 365, as well as third-party platforms like Salesforce, ServiceNow, and Zendesk. And with our Copilot for Finance, we are drawing context from dynamics, as well as ERP systems like SAP to reduce labor-intensive processes like collections and contract and invoice capture for companies like Dentsu and IDC. ISVs are also building their own co-pilot integrations. For example, new integrations between Adobe Experience Cloud and Copilot will help marketeers access campaign insights in the flow of their work. When it comes to devices, Copilot in Windows is now available on nearly 225 million Windows 10 and Windows 11 PCs, up 2x quarter-over-quarter. With Copilot, we have an opportunity to create an entirely new category of devices, purpose-built for this new generation of AI. All of our largest OEM partners have announced AI PCs in recent months. And this quarter, we introduced new surface devices, which includes integrated NPUs to power on-device AI experiences like auto framing and live captions. And there is much more to come in just a few weeks, we’ll hold a special event to talk about our AI vision across Windows and devices. When it comes to Teams, we once again saw year-over-year usage growth. We’re rolling out a new version, which is up to two times faster while using 50% less memory to all customers. We surpassed 1 million Teams Rooms for the first time as we continue to make hybrid meetings better with new AI-powered features like automatic camera switching and speaker recognition. And Teams Phone continues to be the market leader in cloud calling now with over 20 million PSTN users, up nearly 30% year-over-year. All of this innovation is driving growth across Microsoft 365 companies across the private and public sector, including Amadeus, BlackRock, Chevron, Ecolab, Kimberly-Clark. All chose our premium E5 offerings this quarter for advanced security, compliance, voice and analytics. Now on to industry and cross-industry clouds. We are also bringing AI-powered transformation to every industry. In health care, DAX Copilot is being used by more than 200 health care organizations, including Providence, Stanford Health Care and WellSpan Health. And in manufacturing, this week at Hannover Messe, customers like BMW, Siemens and Volvo Penta shared how they're using our cloud and AI solutions to transform factory operations. Now on to security. Security underpins every layer of the tech stack, and it's our number one priority. We launched our Secure Future Initiative last fall for this reason, bringing together every part of the company to advance cybersecurity protection, and we are doubling down on this very important work, putting security above all else, before all other features and investments. We are focused on making continuous progress across the six pillars of this initiative as we protect tenants and isolate production systems, protect identities and secrets, protect networks, protect engineering systems, monitor and detect threats, and accelerate responses and remediation. We remain committed to sharing our learnings, tools and innovation with customers. A great example is Copilot for Security, which we made generally available earlier this month, bringing together LLMs with domain-specific skills informed by our threat intelligence and 78 trillion daily security signals to provide security teams with actionable insights. Now let me talk about our consumer businesses starting with LinkedIn. We continue to combine our unique data with this new generation of AI to transform the way members learn, sell and get hired. Features like LinkedIn AI-assisted messages are seeing a 40% higher acceptance rate and accepted over 10% faster by job seekers, saving hirers time and making it easier to connect them to candidates. Our AI-powered collaborative articles, which has reached over 12 million contributions are helping increase engagement on the platform, which reached a new record this quarter. New AI features are also helping accelerate LinkedIn Premium growth with revenue up 29% year-over-year. And we are also seeing strength across our other businesses with hiring taking share for the seventh consecutive quarter. Now on to search, advertising and news. We once again took share across Bing and Edge as we continue to apply this new generation of AI to transform how people search and browse. Bing reached over 140 million daily active users, and we are particularly encouraged by our momentum in mobile. Our free Copilot apps on iOS and Android saw a surge in downloads after our Super Bowl ad and are among the highest rated in this category. We also rolled out Copilot to our ad platform this quarter, helping marketeers use AI to generate recommendations for product images, headlines and descriptions. Now on to gaming. We are committed to meeting players where they are by bringing great games to more people on more devices. We set third quarter records for game streaming hours, console usage and monthly active devices. And last month, we added our first Activision Blizzard title Diablo IV to our Game Pass service. Subscribers played over 10 million hours within the first 10 days, making it one of our biggest first-party Game Pass launches ever. We were also encouraged by ongoing success of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, which is attracting new gamers and retaining franchise loyalists. Finally, we are expanding our games to new platforms, bringing four of our fan favorite titles to Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation for the first time. In fact, earlier this month, we had seven games among the top 25 on the PlayStation store more than any other publisher. In closing, I'm energized about our opportunity ahead as we innovate to help people and businesses thrive in this new era. With that, let me turn it over to Amy.
Amy Hood: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter revenue was $61.9 billion, up 17%; and earnings per share was $2.94, up 20%. Results exceeded expectations, and we delivered another quarter of double-digit top and bottom line growth with continued share gains across many of our businesses. In our commercial business, bookings increased 29% and 31% in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by Azure commitments with an increase in average deal size and deal length as well as strong execution across our core annuity sales motions. In Microsoft 365, suite strength contributed to ARPU expansion for our Office Commercial business, although new business growth continued to moderate for stand-alone products sold outside the Microsoft 365 suite. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 20% and 21% in constant currency to $235 billion. Roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 20% year-over-year. The remaining portion recognized beyond the next 12 months increased 21%. And this quarter, our annuity mix increased to 97%. In our consumer business, PC market demand was slightly better than we expected, benefiting Windows OEM, while advertising spend landed relatively in line with our expectations. In gaming, we also saw better-than-expected performance of Activision titles, benefiting Xbox content and services. At a company level, Activision contributed a net impact of approximately 4 points to revenue growth, was a 2-point drag on operating income growth and had a negative $0.04 impact to earnings per share. A reminder, that this net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from our prior relationship as a third-party partner to first party and also includes $935 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related costs. FX did not have a significant impact on our results and was roughly in line with our expectations on total company revenue, segment level revenue, COGS and operating expense growth. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $35.1 billion and grew 23%, ahead of expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 72%, a bit better than expected. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, gross margin percentage increased slightly, driven by improvement in Azure and Office 365, even with the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure. Company gross margin dollars increased 18% and gross margin percentage increased slightly year-over-year to 70%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point even with the impact from the purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Growth was driven by the improvement in Azure and Office 365 just mentioned as well as sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 10% with 9 points from the Activision acquisition. At a total company level, head count at the end of March was 1% lower than a year ago. Operating income increased 23% and operating margins increased roughly 2 points year-over-year to 45%, excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins increased roughly 3 points, driven by the higher gross margin noted earlier and improved operating leverage through continued cost discipline. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $19.6 billion and grew 12% and 11% in constant currency, in line with expectations. Office Commercial revenue grew 13% and 12% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 15%, in line with expectations, driven by healthy renewal execution, ARPU growth from continued E5 momentum and early Copilot for Microsoft 365 progress. Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 8% year-over-year with installed base expansion across all customer segments. Seat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings, although growth continued to moderate in SMB. Office Commercial Licensing declined 20% and 18% in constant currency, with continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Office Consumer revenue increased 4%, slightly below expectations. Microsoft 365 subscriptions grew 14% to $80.8 million. LinkedIn revenue increased 10% and 9% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by slightly better-than-expected performance in our premium subscriptions and Talent Solutions businesses. However, in Talent Solutions, bookings growth continues to be impacted by the weaker hiring environment in key verticals. Dynamics revenue grew 19% and 17% in constant currency, ahead of expectations. Growth was driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 23% and 22% in constant currency with continued growth across all workloads and better-than-expected new business, although bookings growth remains moderated. Segment gross margin dollars increased 11%, and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased slightly driven by improvement in Office 365. Operating expenses increased 1% and operating income increased 17% and 16% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $26.7 billion, increasing 21%, ahead of expectations with better-than-expected results across all businesses. Overall, Server products and cloud services revenue grew 24%. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 31% ahead of expectations, while our AI services contributed 7 points of growth as expected. In the non-AI portion of our consumption business, we saw greater-than-expected demand broadly across industries and customer segments as well as some benefit from a greater-than-expected mix of contracts with higher in-period recognition. In our per-user business, the Enterprise Mobility and Security installed base grew 10% to over 274 million seats, with continued impact from the growth trends in new stand-alone business noted earlier. In our on-premises server business, revenue increased 6%, ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected renewal strength, particularly for contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition. Enterprise and partner services revenue decreased 9% on a strong prior year comparable for enterprise support services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 20% and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate [indiscernible] percentage increased slightly, primarily driven by the improvement in Azure noted earlier, even with the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure. Operating expenses increased 1% and operating income grew 32%. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $15.6 billion, increasing 17% with 15 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Results were above expectations, driven by better-than-expected performance in gaming and Windows OEM. Windows OEM revenue increased 11% year-over-year, ahead of expectations, primarily driven by the slightly better PC market noted earlier as well as mix shift to higher monetizing markets. Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 13% and 12% in constant currency, below expectations with impact from the growth trends in new stand-alone business noted earlier as well as lower in-period revenue recognition from a mix of contracts. Devices revenue decreased 17% and 16% in constant currency as we remain focused on our higher-margin premium products. Overall, Surface demand was slightly lower than expected. Search and News advertising revenue ex TAC increased 12% ahead of expectations with continued volume growth and increased engagement on Bing and Edge. And in gaming. Revenue increased 51% and 50% in constant currency with 55 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Results were ahead of expectations, primarily driven by Call of Duty. Xbox content and services revenue increased 62% and 61% in constant currency with 61 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Xbox hardware revenue decreased 31% and 30% in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars increased 27% and 26% in constant currency, with 13 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Gross margin percentage increased roughly 4 points year-over-year, primarily driven by sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 41% with 43 points from the Activision acquisition. Operating income increased 16% and 15% in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $14 billion to support our cloud demand, inclusive of the need to scale our AI infrastructure. Cash paid for PP&E was $11 billion. Cash flow from operations was $31.9 billion, up 31%, driven by strong cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $21 billion, up 18% year-over-year, reflecting higher capital expenditures to support our cloud and AI offerings. This quarter, other income and expense was negative $854 million, lower than anticipated, driven by losses on investments accounted for under the equity method. Our effective tax rate was approximately 18%. And finally, we returned $8.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Now moving to our Q4 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S. dollar basis. First, FX. Based on current rates, which reflect the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we now expect FX to decrease total revenue and segment level revenue growth by less than 1 point. When compared to our January guide for Q4, FX, this is a decrease to total revenue of roughly $700 million. We expect FX to decrease COGS growth by approximately 1 point and operating expense growth by less than 1 point. In commercial bookings, we expect solid growth on a relatively flat expiry base driven by continued strong commercial sales execution. As a reminder, larger, long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, can drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should decrease roughly 2 points year-over-year. Excluding the impact from the change in accounting estimate, Q4 cloud gross margin percentage will be down slightly as improvement in Azure, inclusive of scaling our AI infrastructure will be offset by sales mix shift to Azure. We expect capital expenditures to increase materially on a sequential basis driven by cloud and AI infrastructure investments. As a reminder, there can be normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure build-outs and the timing of finance leases. We continue to bring capacity online as we scale our AI investments with growing demand. Currently, near-term AI demand is a bit higher than our available capacity. Next, to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 9% and 11% in constant currency or US$19.9 billion to US$20.2 billion. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth primarily through E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be approximately 14% in constant currency. We continue to progress with adoption of CoPilot for Microsoft 365 and remain excited for the long-term growth opportunity. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the mid to high teens. In Office Consumer, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the mid to high single digits driven by continued growth across all businesses. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-teens, driven by Dynamics 365. For both LinkedIn and Dynamics, the continued bookings growth moderation noted earlier is a headwind to Q4 revenue growth. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 19% and 20% in constant currency or US$28.4 billion to US$28.7 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q4 revenue growth to be 30% to 31% in constant currency or similar to our stronger-than-expected Q3 results. Growth will be driven by our Azure Consumption business and continued contribution from AI with some impact from the AI capacity availability noted earlier. Our per-user business should see benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum. Though we expect continued moderation in seat growth rates given the size of the installed base. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits with continued hybrid demand, including licenses running in multi-cloud environments. And in Enterprise and Partner Services revenue should decline in the mid- to high single digits on a high prior year comparable for enterprise support services. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to grow between 10% and 13% in constant currency or US$15.2 billion to US$15.6 billion. Windows OEM revenue growth should be in the low to mid-single digits as PC market unit volumes continue at pre-pandemic levels. In Windows Commercial Products and Cloud Services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive revenue growth in the mid-single digits. As a reminder, our quarterly revenue growth can have variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Devices, revenue should decline in the mid-teens as we continue to focus on our higher-margin premium products. Search and news advertising ex TAC revenue growth should be in the low to mid-teens, driven by continued volume strength. This will be higher than overall search and news advertising revenue growth, which we expect to be relatively flat. And in Gaming, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-40s, including approximately 50 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the high 50s driven by approximately 60 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Hardware revenue will decline again year-over-year. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS between US$19.6 billion to US$19.8 billion, including approximately $700 million from purchase accounting, integration and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. We expect operating expense of US$17.15 billion to US$17.25 billion, including approximately $300 million from purchase accounting, integration and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Therefore, we now expect full year FY2024 operating margins to be up over 2 points year-over-year, even with our cloud and AI investments, the impact from the Activision acquisition and the headwind from the change in useful lives last year. This operating margin expansion reflects the hard work across every team to drive efficiencies and maintain disciplined cost management, knowing we will continue to grow our cloud and AI investments next year. Other income and expense should be roughly negative $850 million as interest income will be more than offset by interest expense and losses on investments accounted for under the equity method. As a reminder, we are required to recognize gains or losses on our equity investments which can increase quarterly volatility. We expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be approximately 18%. Now I’d like to share some closing thoughts as we look to the next fiscal year. We continue to focus on building businesses that create meaningful value for our customers and therefore, significant growth opportunities for years to come. In FY2025, that focus on execution should again lead to double-digit revenue and operating income growth to scale to meet the growing demand signal for our cloud and AI products, we expect FY2025 capital expenditures to be higher than FY2024. These expenditures over the course of the next year are dependent on demand signals and adoption of our services. So we will manage that signal through the year. We will also continue to prioritize operating leverage. And therefore, we expect FY2025 operating margins to be down only about 1 point year-over-year, even with our significant cloud and AI investments, as well as a full year of impact from the Activision acquisition. We are leading the AI platform wave and are committed to bringing that value to our global customers as we enter the final quarter of our fiscal year. With that, let’s go to Q&A, Brett.
Brett Iversen: Thanks, Amy. We’ll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Keith Weiss: Thank you, guys for taking the question and congratulations on a fantastic quarter. A lot of excitement in the marketplace around generative AI and the potential of these technologies, but there’s also a lot of investment going on behind them. It looks like Microsoft is on track to ramp CapEx over 50% year-on-year this year to over $50 billion. And there’s media speculation of more spending ahead with some reports talking about like $100 billion data center. So obviously, investments are coming well ahead of the revenue contribution. But what I was hoping for is that you could give us some color on how use as the management team, try to quantify the potential opportunities that underlie these investments because they are getting very big. And maybe if you could give us some hint on whether there's any truth to the potential of like $100 billion data center out there? Thank you so much.
Satya Nadella: Thank you, Keith for the question, let me start and then Amy, you can add. At a high level, the way we, as a management team, talk about it is there are two sides to this, right? There is training and their inference. Given that we want to be a leader in this big generational shift and paradigm shift in technology, that's on the training side. We want to be able to allocate the capital required to essentially be training these large foundation models and stay on the leadership position there. And we've done that successfully all the way today, and you've seen it flow through our P&L, and you can continue to see that going forward. Then Amy referenced what we also do on the inference side, which is, one, we first innovate and build products. And of course, we have an infrastructure business that's also dependent on a lot of ISVs building products that run on our infrastructure. And it's all going to be demand driven. In other words, we track – we're closely what's happening with inference demand, and that's something that we will manage, as Amy said in her remarks very, very closely. So we feel – and obviously, we've been doing this, quite frankly, Keith, for now multiple years. So this is not the quarter. I realize in the news, it's a lot more in the quarter nowadays. But if you look at it, we have been doing what is essentially capital allocation to be a leader in AI for multiple years now, and we plan to sort of essentially keep taking that forward.
Amy Hood: And Keith, I do think it's important to really think about our planning cycles and we do talk about spending sequentially higher. And we look forward to being able to continue to build out the infrastructure needed to meet the demand. Another thing that you’ve really asked in the beginning was the opportunity and the size of that. And I think in some ways, it's important to think about every business process that can be impacted and the opportunity that's represented by every business process. And so when you think of it that way, I think the opportunity is significant. The opportunity to power that next wave of “cloud infrastructure” is important. It's important because we've been the leader for this decade of the cloud transition, and it's important for us to confidently invest to do that in the second wave, building on our success in the first. And I think that's really the best way to think about how we'll spend is the same way we approached it for a decade. Watch the signal, invest to be a leader in the technical foundation and then execute consistently to add value to customers. The opportunity is represented by the amount of value we add and I look forward to being able to continue to deliver that.
Keith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you so much.
Brett Iversen: Thanks, Keith. Operator, next question please.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed.
Brent Thill: Satya, how would you characterize the demand environment? On one hand, you have bookings in Azure both accelerating year-over-year in the quarter, but we're seeing a lot of future concern hesitation from other vendors we all cover. So, I think everyone love to get your sense of budget health for customers this year.
Satya Nadella: Great question, Brent. There are a couple of things I’d say. On the Azure side, which I think is what you specifically asked, we feel very good about the – we are fundamentally a share taker there because if you look at it from our perspective at this point, Azure has become a protocol for pretty much anybody who is doing an AI project. And so that's sort of been a significant help for us in terms of acquiring even new customers. Some of the logos I even referenced in my remarks, our new Azure customers. So, that's one. The second thing that we're also seeing is AI just doesn't sit on its own. So, AI projects obviously start with calls to AI models, but they also use a vector database. In fact, Azure Search, which is really used by even ChatGPT is one of the fastest-growing services for us. We have Fabric integration to Azure AI. And so, Cosmos DB integration. So, the data tier, the dev tools is another place where we are seeing great traction. So, we are seeing adjacent services in Azure that get attached to AI. And lastly, I would say, migrations to Azure as well. So, this is not just all an AI story. We are also looking at customers, I mean, this is something that we have talked about in the past, which is there's always an optimization cycle, but there's also – as people optimize, they spend money on new project starts, which will grow and then they'll optimize. So, it's a continuous side of it. So, these are the three trends that are playing out on Azure in terms of what at least we see on demand side.
Brent Thill: Thank you.
Brett Iversen: Thanks, Brent. Operator, next question please.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.
Mark Moerdler: Thank you very much for taking my question and congratulates on the quarter and the guidance. I want to follow up on the AI, obviously. We’re seeing companies shifting their IT spending to invest in and learn about AI rather than receiving additional budgets for AI. At some point, for AI to be transformative, as everyone expects, it needs to be accretive to spending. Satya, when do you believe AI will hit the maturity level, will be net increase to IT or outside of IT spending? And what would be the leading indicators of that maturation? And Amy, am I characterizing this correctly as it relates to Azure? Some projects are being delayed so that, that spending could be shifted from core Azure toward Azure AI? Thank you.
Satya Nadella: Yes. Great set of questions, Mark. Let me just start by saying, a good place to start is to watch what’s happening in terms of standard issues for software teams, right? I mean if you think about it, they bought tools in the past. Now, you basically buy tools plus Copilot, right? So, you could even say that this is characterized as perhaps shift of what is OpEx dollars into effectively tool spend because it gives operating leverage to all of the OpEx dollars you’re spending today, right? That’s really a good example of, I think, what’s going to happen across the board. We see that in customer service. We see that in sales. We see that in marketing. Anywhere, there’s operations. That’s why I described it as knowledge turns. You can even think of it as lean for knowledge work, right, because it just reduces waste, increases speed, and customer value. And so, one of the interesting rate limiters here is culture change inside of organizations. When I say culture change that means process change. And Amy referenced this even in her answer to the first question because at the end of the day companies will have to take a process, simplify the process, automate the process, and apply these solutions. And so that requires not just technology, but in fact, companies to go do the hard work of culturally changing how they adopt technology to drive that operating leverage. And this is where we are going to see firm-level performance differences. So, one of the things we see is any customer who is working closely with us deploying it internally at Microsoft we see it, right. We’re also taking our own medicine to apply this across every process. And we know that this is not just about technology, it’s about being able to have the methodology that goes with it. And so, we see it in software development. We see it in customer service. We’re seeing it even in the horizontal use of Copilot today where every day people are discovering new workflows that they can optimize. And so, that’s like the PC when it became standard issue in early 1990s. That’s the closest analogy I can come up with. And so, yes, it will take time for it to percolate through the economy, but this is faster diffusion, faster rate of adoption than anything we have seen in the past, as evidenced even by Copilot, right. It’s faster than any suite we have sold in the past, but it is going to require workflow and process change.
Amy Hood: And Mark, maybe to answer your question on, are we seeing project starts transition from maybe the – something that was core consumption to an AI project? In our results, that’s not what we saw. We saw more what Satya was speaking to earlier, which is, you see maybe growth in migrations again. You’re seeing work in the data space, again, and you’re seeing AI project starts. And I think that’s why maybe you see our growth be different, of course, than you see IT budget spend. It’s because it’s a share, I think, improvement plus also really focusing on what Satya said, it’s about spending maybe in other areas that we don’t traditionally think of as being in the IT budget spend under a CIO. It’s spend being done by the Head of Customer Service, it’s spend being done by the Head of Marketing. And I do think that will be important as we think about the opportunity ahead.
Mark Moerdler: Incredibly helpful. Thank you both.
Brett Iversen: Thanks, Mark. Operator, next question please.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed.
Karl Keirstead: Thank you. And Satya and Amy, congrats on these outstanding Azure results. I’d love to hone in a little bit on the seven-point lift to Azure growth from AI, outstanding number, but it’s leveling off a little bit from six points in December. I’m wondering if you could unpack that a little bit. To what extent did the capacity issues that you Amy highlighted on the call, impact that number? Is there any seasonality? I wouldn’t think so or any other factor that can swing around that number that you’d advise us to keep in mind? Thanks so much.
Amy Hood: Thanks, Karl. There’s not a seasonality to the numbers. So, you’re absolutely right to start there, and it’s a good question. The way to think about it is a bit more by – it is how much capacity we have in play and how much capacity that we have to sell on the inferencing side, in particular. And so, that is partially why you see the capital investment in the shape that is, is because right this minute, we do have demand that exceeds our supply by a bit. So, it is fair to say that, that could have been an impact on the number for the quarter and it does impact a little bit the number in Q4.
Karl Keirstead: Okay. Helpful. Thank you.
Brett Iversen: Thanks, Karl. Operator, next question please.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed.
Raimo Lenschow: Thank you. I have more conceptual question for Satya. If you think about Copilots and what you're doing there, you're kind of impacting a lot of this in businesses and the opportunities seem very broad-based. How do you think this will play out in the industry between you guys offering certain Copilots versus like the rest of the industry following and everyone seems to have a Copilot now and seems to be talking about it. How does that impact what do you want to do, your partner strategy going forward? Thank you.
Satya Nadella: Yes, it's a great question. So the way we see it play out is, if you think about it, the way Office was used broadly for knowledge work was in the context of business processes, right? So it's not like – when people do knowledge work, they're not doing knowledge work, they're doing knowledge work and support of making progress in the context of sales enablement, customer service, revenue ops, supply chain or what have you, right? So that's the first thing to note. And they do it inside of e-mail. They do it inside of Teams. They do it inside of Excel, PowerPoint, Word and what have you. Now we have the ability to essentially bridge the work and the work artifacts inside of these knowledge worker tools with the workflow and the business process and the business process data. So when we think about our Copilot, our Copilot has that ability to integrate, whether it's with ServiceNow, it has the ability to integrate with SAP with Salesforce, with obviously Dynamics. That's what we are seeing. In fact, you'll hear us talk a lot about it at our developer conference, which is the extensibility and Copilot Studio is really off to the races in terms of the product that most people are excited because one of the things in the enterprise if you want to ground your Copilot with enterprise data, which is in all of these SaaS applications and Copilot Studio is the tool to use it, to make that happen. And so that's what we are seeing, which is we are building a Copilot, which also happens to be an orchestrator of all in other Copilots, which to us appear as extensions. And net-net, what happens is some of these knowledge worker tools that people have used all the time, right? Because when you think about Teams, when you're having a meeting, you're not doing a random meeting, the meeting is in the context of some business process. It could be a supply chain meeting where you're trying to understand which suppliers to bet on or what terms to do. And so now you can access all that data right in the Team's context. So that's I think what's exciting for us, having built all these horizontal tools, which I would say we're under underappreciated for the amount of work. How people use those tools to make progress on business process, but we now get to bridge that between the business applications and knowledge worker tools, tomorrow horizontally.
Raimo Lenschow: Okay. Perfect. Thank you.
Brett Iversen: Thanks Raimo. Operator, next question please.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
Michael Turrin: Hey. Great. Appreciate you taking the question. I wanted to go back to Azure. You've been hinting at stabilization there for the past couple of quarters, but still very good to see the balance. Maybe you can expand on just what the commercial bookings number, appreciating the variability there does in terms of visibility. And any characterization you can give us around what you're seeing in areas like cost optimization and core workload growth coming back is just helpful context for us in unpacking the numbers. Thank you.
Amy Hood: Thanks, Michael. I may take those a bit in reverse. It's a little easier to address them. When you think about – we've been talking about sort of stabilization and what you saw this quarter, if you break down the Azure number as you saw, which I think I talked a little bit about with Karl was 7 points of contribution from AI, and you could call them the difference '24 from our core really Azure business. And within that, the activity we saw and the consumption side was really this balance that we were quite used to and have seen throughout the cloud transition. We saw new workload starts and we saw optimizations. And then those optimizations create new budget, and you apply it. And that cycle which is actually quite normal. We saw it again this quarter in a balanced way. And I think when we talk about stabilization or even what we saw between Q2 and Q3, which is a bit of acceleration in that core, was a lot of the newer project starts relating back to not just AI starts, but lots of other workflows. The companies are still going from on-prem to cloud, Satya mentioned migrations. And some of that, which I know isn't as exciting as talking about all the AI projects. This is still really foundational work to allow companies to take advantage of the cost savings and the total TCO is still really good. And so I think that balance is really what you saw this quarter, and I do feel like there wasn't really a big difference, Michael, across industries or across geos. So I would say it was actually pretty consistent is the other maybe texture that I could give you to that question. And so then when you're saying do we keep sort of pointing to stabilization, I really do look sort of workload to workload. What are we seeing? Where it starts? And this one actually felt quite balanced and optimization looks like they normally would, which by the way, is super important. It's something we encourage customers to do. You want to run your workloads as efficiently as you possibly can. It's critical to customers being able to grow and get value out of that. So I sometimes think we – you all may ask the question more as a negative. And for us, it's just about a healthy cycle at the customer account level.
Michael Turrin: Consistent core cloud growth is still pretty exciting to us as well. Thank you.
Amy Hood: Thank you.
Brett Iversen: Thanks, Michael. Operator, next question please?
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.
Kirk Materne: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I'll add my congrats in the quarter. Hey Satya, I was wondering if you could chime in on a discussion that comes up a lot with investors, which is, is there a sort of data quality problem in the market in terms of being able to take advantage of all these new GenAI capabilities? And I was just curious, if you could comment on, do you see companies making inroads on sort of addressing that? And do you see that as sort of an inhibitor to AI growth at all at this point? Thanks.
Satya Nadella: Yes, it's a great question because there are two sets of things in order to make sense for successful deployment of these new AI capabilities. I mean if you sort of say this, what is this AI, it does two things, right? There's a new user experience, there is a natural language interface and second thing is it's the reasoning engine. And the reasoning engine requires good data, and it's good requires, good data for grounding, right? So people talk about something called retrieval augmented generation. And in that context, having good grounding data that then help with the reasoning, I think, is helpful. And then, of course, people are also looking to sort of fine-tune or RLHF or essentially take the large model and ground it further. So all of these tools are now available, the sophistication of how to people can deploy these models across various business processes where there is data and where there is tuning of these models is also getting more widespread, even at system integrators and other developers are there to help enterprises. So all that's maturing. So we feel good. And this is what I think on the commercial side, these are some of the harder problems to solve broad consumer, right? I mean I think this is a couple of orders of magnitude of improvements in, I'll call it, our models before we can sort of have more sophisticated open-ended consumer scenarios. Whereas in the enterprise, these are all things we can go tackle. Again, I point to get up, if you think about how it's got an entire system, right? It's just not an AI model. It's the, AI – the user experience, scaffolding, the editor, the chat, then interpreter and the debugger work along with the continuations of the model to help essentially create these reasoning traces, which help the entire thing work. And effectively, what we are doing with Copilot, Copilot Studio and connectors to all these business systems, think of it as we are creating GitHub Copilot like scenarios for every business system. That's what I think is going to have both what Amy referenced is business value and better grounding. But you're absolutely right in saying a lot of work we're doing with Fabric or Cosmos or PostgreSQL is about preparing that data so that it can be integrated with these AI projects.
Kirk Materne: Thank you.
Brett Iversen: Thanks, Kirk. Operator, we have time for one last question.
Operator: Our last question will come from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed.
Alex Zukin: Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask the AI question but from a Microsoft 365 Copilot perspective. I think you talked a little bit about starting to see some of those impacts positively in the quarter on the office business. I wanted to ask more broadly around that capacity constraint that you alluded to in your prepared remarks, Amy. And kind of how does the easing – how tied are we like as you invest for that CapEx and bring more of the capacity online. How much does that unlock or unlock the ability to deliver both a higher Azure AI number as well as a higher Microsoft 365 Copilot number.
Amy Hood: Thanks for the question. It's a good opportunity to clarify. And I would not say that there is a capacity constraint on the Copilots. It's a real priority for us to make sure we optimize the allocation of our capacity to make sure that those per user businesses are able to continue to grow. And so think about that as our priority one. And so then what that does mean is capacity constraints when we have them, you'll tend to see them on the Azure infrastructure side, the consumption side of the business is a better way of thinking about it
Alex Zukin: Perfect. Thank you.
Brett Iversen: Thanks, Alex. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon.
Satya Nadella: Thank you all.
Amy Hood: Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.",2024-04-25
MSFT,2024,4,2024-Q4-MSFT,"Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Microsoft Fiscal Year 2024 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Brett Iversen, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Brett Iversen: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer, Alice Jolla, Chief Accounting Officer, and Keith Dolliver, Corporate Secretary and Deputy General Counsel. On the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today’s call and provides the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. More detailed outlook slides will be available on the Microsoft Investor Relations website when we provide outlook commentary on today’s call. On this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP items. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's fourth quarter performance in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results. All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency, when available, as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are the same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rate only. We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript, and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website. During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements which are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the risk factor section of our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Satya.
Satya Nadella: Thank you, Brett. We had a solid close to our fiscal year. All-up, annual revenue was more than $245 billion, up 15% year-over-year. And Microsoft Cloud revenue surpassed $135 billion, up 23%. Before I dive in, I want to offer some broader perspective on the AI platform shift. Similar to the cloud, this transition involves both knowledge and capital intensive investments. And as we go through this shift, we are focused on two fundamental things: First, driving innovation across a product portfolio that spans infrastructure and applications so as to ensure that we are maximizing our opportunity, while in parallel continuing to scale our cloud business and prioritizing fundamentals, starting with security. Second, using customer demand signal and time to value to manage our cost structure dynamically and generate durable, long-term operating leverage. With that, let me highlight examples, starting with Azure. Our share gains accelerated this year, driven by AI. We expanded our datacenter footprint, announcing investments across four continents. These are long-term assets around the world to drive growth for the next decade and beyond. We added new AI accelerators from AMD and NVIDIA, as well as our own first party silicon Azure Maia. And we introduced new Cobalt 100, which provides best-in-class performance for customers like Elastic, MongoDB, Siemens, Snowflake, and Teradata. We continued to see sustained revenue growth from migrations. Azure Arc is helping customers in every industry, from ABB and Cathay Pacific, to LaLiga, to streamline their cloud migrations. We now have 36,000 Arc customers, up 90% year-over-year. We remain the hyperscale cloud of choice for SAP and Oracle workloads. Atos, Coles, Daimler Truck AG, Domino’s, Haleon, for example, all migrated their mission-critical SAP workloads to our cloud. And with our Azure VMware Solution, we offer the fastest and most cost-effective way for customers to migrate their VMware workloads too. With Azure AI, we are building out the app server for the AI wave, providing access to the most diverse selection of models to meet customers’ unique cost, latency, and design considerations. All-up, we now have over 60,000 Azure AI customers, up nearly 60% year-over-year, and average spend per customer continues to grow. Azure OpenAI Service provides access to best-in-class frontier models, including as of this quarter GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini. It is being used by leading companies in every industry, including H&R Block, Suzuki, Swiss Re, Telstra as well as digital natives like Freshworks, Meesho, and Zomato. With Phi-3, we offer a family of powerful, small language models, which are being used by companies like BlackRock, Emirates, Epic, ITC, Navy Federal Credit Union, and others. And with Models as a Service, we provide API access to third-party models, including as of last week the latest from Cohere, Meta, and Mistral. The number of paid Models as a Service customers more than doubled quarter-over-quarter, and we are seeing increased usage by leaders in every industry, from Adobe and Bridgestone, to Novo Nordisk and Palantir. Now, on to data. Our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform provides customers with the broadest capabilities spanning databases, analytics, business intelligence, and governance along with seamless integration with all of our AI services. The number of Azure AI customers also using our data and analytics tools grew nearly 50% year-over-year. Microsoft Fabric, our AI-powered next generation data platform – now has over 14,000 paid customers, including leaders in every industry, from Accenture and Kroger, to Rockwell Automation and Zeiss up 20% quarter-over-quarter. And, this quarter, we introduced new first-of-their-kind real-time intelligence capabilities in Fabric so customers can unlock insights on high-volume, time sensitive data. Now, on to developer tools. GitHub Copilot is by far the most widely adopted AI-powered developer tool. Just over two years since its general availability, more than 77,000 organizations from BBVA, FedEx, and H&M, to Infosys and Paytm have adopted Copilot, up 180% year-over-year. And we are going further. With Copilot Workspace, we offer Copilot-native end-to-end developer productivity across plan, build, test, debug, and deploy cycle. Copilot is driving GitHub growth, all up, GitHub’s annual revenue run rate is now $2 billion. Copilot accounted for over 40% of GitHub revenue growth this year, and is already a larger business than all of GitHub was when we acquired it. We are also integrating generative AI across Power Platform, enabling anyone to use natural language to create apps, automate workflows, or build a website. To date, over 480,000 organizations have used AI-powered capabilities in Power Platform, up 45% quarter-over-quarter. In total, we now have 48 million monthly active users of Power Platform, up 40% year-over-year. Now, on to future of work. Copilot for Microsoft 365 is becoming a daily habit for knowledge workers, as it transforms work, workflow, and work artifacts. The number of people who use Copilot daily at work nearly doubled quarter-over-quarter, as they use it to complete tasks faster, hold more effective meetings, and automate business workflows and processes. Copilot customers increased more than 60% quarter-over-quarter. Feedback has been positive, with majority of enterprise customers coming back to purchase more seats. All-up, the number of customers with more than 10,000 seats more than doubled quarter-over-quarter, including Capital Group, Disney, Dow, Kyndryl, Novartis. And EY alone will deploy Copilot to 150,000 of its employees. And we are going further, adding agent capabilities to Copilot. New Team Copilot can facilitate meetings, and create and assign tasks. And, with Copilot Studio, customers can extend Copilot for Microsoft 365 and build custom copilots that proactively respond to data and events using their own first and third-party business data. To date, 50,000 organizations from Carnival Corporation, Cognizant, and Eaton, to KPMG, Majesco, and McKinsey have used Copilot Studio, up over 70% quarter-over-quarter. We are also extending Copilot to specific industries, including healthcare, with DAX Copilot. More than 400 healthcare organizations including Community Health Network, Intermountain, Northwestern Memorial Healthcare, and Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center have purchased DAX Copilot to date, up 40% quarter-over-quarter, and the number of AI-generated clinical reports more than tripled. Copilot is also transforming ERP and CRM business applications. We again took share this quarter, as customers like ThermoFisher Scientific switched to Dynamics. Our new Dynamics 365 Contact Center is a Copilot-first solution that infuses generative AI throughout the contact center workflow. Companies like 1-800 Flowers, Mediterranean Shipping, Synoptek will rely on it to deliver better customer support. And Dynamics 365 Business Central is now trusted by over 40,000 organizations for core ERP. Microsoft Teams has become essential to how hundreds of millions of people meet, call, chat, collaborate, and do business. We once again saw year-over-year usage growth. Teams Premium has surpassed 3 million seats, up nearly 400% year-over-year, as organizations like dentsu, Eli Lilly, and Ford chose it for advanced features like end-to-end encryption and real-time translation. When it comes to devices, we introduced our new category of Copilot+ PCs this quarter. They are the fastest, most intelligent Windows PCs ever, and they include a new system architecture designed to deliver best-in-class performance and breakthrough AI experiences. We are delighted by early reviews. And we are looking forward to the introduction of more Copilot+ PCs powered by all of our silicon and OEM partners in the coming months. More broadly, Windows 11 active devices increased 50% year-over-year. And we are seeing accelerated adoption of Windows 11 by companies like Carlsberg, E.ON, National Australia Bank. Now, on to security. We continue to prioritize security above all else. We are doubling down on our Secure Future Initiative, as we implement our principles of secure by design, secure by default, and secure operations. Through this initiative, we are also continually applying what we are learning, and translating it into innovation for our customers, including how we approach AI. Over 1,000 paid customers used Copilot for Security, including Alaska Airlines, Oregon State University, Petrofac, Wipro, WTW. And we are also securing customers’ AI deployments, with updates to Defender and Purview. All-up, we now have over 1.2 million security customers. Over 800,000 including Dell Technologies, Deutsche Telekom, TomTom use four or more workloads, up 25% year-over-year. And Defender for Cloud, our cloud security solution, surpassed $1 billion in revenue over the past 12 months as we protect customer workloads across multi-cloud and hybrid environments. Now, let me turn to our consumer businesses, starting with LinkedIn. LinkedIn continues to see accelerated member growth and record engagement. 1.5 million pieces of content are shared every minute on the platform. And video is now the fastest growing format on LinkedIn, with uploads up 34% year-over-year. LinkedIn Marketing Solutions continues to be a leader in B2B digital advertising, helping companies deliver the right message, to the right audience, on a safe, trusted platform. And when it comes to our subscription businesses, Premium sign ups increased 51% this fiscal year, and we are adding even more value to our members and customers with new AI tools. Our reimagined AI-powered LinkedIn Premium experience is now available for every Premium subscriber worldwide, helping them more easily and intuitively connect to opportunity, learn, and get career coaching. Finally, hiring took share for the second consecutive year. And, now, on to Search, Advertising and News. We are ensuring that Bing, Edge, and Copilot collectively are driving more engagement and value to end-users, publishers, and advertisers. Our overall revenue ex-TAC increased 19% year-over-year, and we again took share across Bing and Edge. We continue to apply generative AI to pioneer new approaches to how people search and browse. Just last week, we announced we are testing a new generative search experience, which creates a dynamic response to a user’s query, while maintaining click share to publishers. And we continue to drive record engagement with Copilot for the web. Consumers have used Copilot to create over 12 billion images and conduct 13 billion chats to date, up 150% since the start of the calendar year. Thousands of news and entertainment publishers trust us to reach new audiences with Microsoft Start. And, in fact, we have paid them $1 billion over the last five years. We are helping advertisers increase their ROI too. We have seen positive response to Performance Max, which uses AI to dynamically create and optimize ads. And Copilot in Microsoft Ad Platform helps marketers create campaigns and troubleshoot using natural language. Now, on to gaming. We now have over 500 million monthly active users across platforms and devices. And our content pipeline has never been stronger. We previewed a record 30 new titles at our showcase this quarter. 18 of them such as Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will be available on Game Pass. Game Pass Ultimate subscribers can now stream games directly on the devices they already have, including as of last month, Amazon Fire TVs. Finally, we are bringing our IP to new audiences. Fallout, for example, made its debut as a TV show on Amazon Prime this quarter. It was the second most watched title on the platform ever, and hours played on Game Pass for Fallout franchise increased nearly 5x quarter-over-quarter. In closing, I am energized about the opportunities ahead. We are investing for the long-term in our fundamentals, in our innovation, and in our people. With that, let me turn it over to Amy.
Amy Hood: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone. This quarter, revenue was $64.7 billion, up 15% and 16% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.95 and increased 10% and 11% in constant currency. In our largest quarter of the year, we again delivered double-digit top and bottom line growth with continued share gains across many of our businesses and record commitments to our Microsoft Cloud platform. Commercial bookings were significantly ahead of expectations and increased 17% and 19% in constant currency. This record commitment quarter was driven by growth in the number of 10-million-dollar-plus and 100-million-dollar-plus contracts for both Azure and Microsoft 365 and consistent execution across our core annuity sales motions. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 20% and 21% in constant currency to $269 billion. Roughly 40% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 18% year-over-year. The remaining portion, recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 21%. And this quarter, our annuity mix was 97%. At a company level, Activision contributed a net impact of approximately 3 points to revenue growth, was a 2 point drag on operating income growth, and had a negative $0.06 impact to earnings per share. A reminder that this net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from our prior relationship as a third-party partner to first-party, and includes $938 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration, and transaction-related costs. FX did not have a significant impact on our results and was roughly in line with our expectations on total company revenue, segment level revenue, COGS, and operating expense growth. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $36.8 billion and grew 21% and 22% in constant currency, roughly in line with expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased roughly 2 points year-over-year to 69% in line with expectations. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, gross margin percentage decreased slightly driven by sales mix shift to Azure, partially offset by improvement in Azure even with the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure. Company gross margin dollars increased 14% and 15% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 70%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased slightly, even with the impact from purchase accounting adjustments, integration, and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Operating expenses increased 13% with 9 points from the Activision acquisition. At a total company level, headcount at the end of June was 3% higher than a year ago. Operating income increased 15% and 16% in constant currency and operating margins were 43%, relatively unchanged year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins increased slightly driven by the higher gross margin noted earlier and improved operating leverage through continued cost discipline. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $20.3 billion and grew 11% and 12% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations driven by better-than-expected results across all business units. Office commercial revenue grew 12% and 13% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 13% and 14% in constant currency with ARPU growth primarily from E5 momentum as well as Copilot for Microsoft 365. Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 7% year-over-year with installed base expansion across all customer segments. Seat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings, although both segments continued to moderate. Office commercial licensing declined 9% and 7% in constant currency, with continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Office consumer revenue increased 3% and 4% in constant currency with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 10% to 82.5 million. LinkedIn revenue increased 10% and 9% in constant currency driven by better-than-expected performance across all businesses. Dynamics revenue grew 16% driven by Dynamics 365 which grew 19% and 20% in constant currency. We saw continued growth across all workloads and better-than-expected new business. Dynamics 365 now represents roughly 90% of total Dynamics revenue. Segment gross margin dollars increased 9% and 10% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 1 point year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased slightly driven by Office 365 as we scale our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 5%, and operating income increased 12% and 13% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $28.5 billion, increasing 19% and 20% in constant currency, in line with expectations. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue grew 21% and 22% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 29% and 30% in constant currency, in line with expectations and consistent with Q3 when adjusting for leap year. Azure growth included 8 points from AI services where demand remained higher than our available capacity. In June, we saw slightly lower-than-expected growth in a few European geos. In our per-user business, the enterprise mobility and security installed base grew 10% to over 281 million seats with continued impact from moderated growth in seats sold outside the Microsoft 365 suite. Therefore, our Azure consumption business continues to grow faster than total Azure. In our on-premises server business, revenue increased 2% and 3% in constant currency. Growth was driven by demand for our hybrid solutions although with slightly lower-than-expected transactional purchasing. Enterprise and partner services revenue decreased 7% on a strong prior year comparable for Enterprise Support Services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 16% and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 2 points year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased slightly driven by sales mix shift to Azure, partially offset by the improvement in Azure noted earlier, even with the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 5% and operating income grew 22% and 23% in constant currency. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $15.9 billion, increasing 14% and 15% in constant currency, with 12 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Results were above expectations driven by Windows commercial and Search. The PC market was as expected and Windows OEM revenue increased 4% year-over-year. Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 11% and 12% in constant currency, ahead of expectations due to higher in-period revenue recognition from the mix of contracts. Devices revenue decreased 11% and 9% in constant currency, roughly in line with expectations, as we remain focused on our higher margin premium products. While early days, we’re excited about the recent launch of our Copilot+ PCs. Search and news advertising revenue ex-TAC increased 19%, ahead of expectations, primarily due to improved execution. Healthy volume growth was driven by Bing and Edge. And in Gaming, revenue increased 44% with 48 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Xbox content and services revenue increased 61%, slightly ahead of expectations, with 58 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Stronger-than-expected performance in first-party content was partially offset by third-party content performance. Xbox hardware revenue decreased 42% and 41% in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars increased 21%, with 10 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Gross margin percentage increased roughly 3 points year-over-year primarily driven by sales mix shift to higher margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 43% with 41 points from the Activision acquisition. Operating income increased 5% and 6% in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures including finance leases were $19 billion, in line with expectations, and cash paid for PP&E was $13.9 billion. Cloud and AI related spend represents nearly all of total capital expenditures. Within that, roughly half is for infrastructure needs where we continue to build and lease datacenters that will support monetization over the next 15 years and beyond. The remaining cloud and AI related spend is primarily for servers, both CPUs and GPUs, to serve customers based on demand signals. For the full fiscal year, the mix of our cloud and AI related spend was similar to Q4. Cash flow from operations was $37.2 billion, up 29% driven by strong cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $23.3 billion, up 18% year-over-year, reflecting higher capital expenditures to support our cloud and AI offerings. For the full-year, cash flow from operations surpassed $100 billion for the first time, reaching $119 billion. This quarter, other income and expense was negative $675 million, more favorable than anticipated with lower-than-expected interest expense and higher-than-expected interest income. Our losses on investments accounted for under the equity method were as expected. Our effective tax rate was approximately 19%, higher than anticipated due to a state tax law signed in June that was effective retroactively. And finally, we returned $8.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, bringing our total cash returned to shareholders to over $34 billion for the full fiscal year. Now, moving to our outlook. My commentary for both the full-year and next quarter is on a U.S. dollar basis unless specifically noted otherwise. Let me start with some full year commentary for FY2025. First, FX. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to have no meaningful impact to full-year revenue, COGS, or operating expense growth. Next, we continue to expect double-digit revenue and operating income growth as we focus on delivering differentiated value for our customers. To meet the growing demand signal for our AI and cloud products, we will scale our infrastructure investments with FY2025 capital expenditures expected to be higher than FY2024. As a reminder, these expenditures are dependent on demand signals and adoption of our services that will be managed through the year. As scaling these investments drives growth in COGS, we will remain disciplined on operating expense management. Therefore, we expect FY2025 OpEx growth to be in the single digits. And given our focused commitment to managing at the operating margin level, we still expect FY2025 operating margins to be down only about one point year-over-year. And finally, we expect our FY2025 effective tax rate to be around 19%. Now, to the outlook for our first quarter. Based on current rates, we expect FX to decrease total revenue and segment level revenue growth by less than one point. We expect FX to decrease COGS growth by less than one point and to have no meaningful impact to operating expense growth. In commercial bookings, increased long-term commitments to our platform and strong execution across core annuity sales motions should drive healthy growth on a growing expiry base. As a reminder, larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, can drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly 70%, down year-over-year driven by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure. We expect capital expenditures to increase on a sequential basis given our cloud and AI demand, as well as existing AI capacity constraints. As a reminder, there can be quarterly spend variability from cloud infrastructure buildouts and the timing of delivery of finance leases. Next to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 10% and 11% in constant currency, or US$20.3 to US$20.6 billion. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5 and Copilot for Microsoft 365. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be approximately 14% in constant currency. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the mid to high-teens. In Office consumer, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the high single digits driven by continued growth across all businesses. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-teens driven by Dynamics 365. For Intelligent Cloud we expect revenue to grow between 18% and 20% in constant currency, or US$28.6 billion to US$28.9 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q1 revenue growth to be 28% to 29% in constant currency. Growth will continue to be driven by our consumption business, inclusive of AI, which is growing faster than total Azure. We expect the consumption trends from Q4 to continue through the first half of the year. This includes both AI demand impacted by capacity constraints and non-AI growth trends similar to June. Growth in our per-user business will continue to moderate. And in H2, we expect Azure growth to accelerate as our capital investments create an increase in available AI capacity to serve more of the growing demand. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline in the low single digits as continued hybrid demand will be more than offset by lower transactional purchasing. And in Enterprise and partner services, revenue should decline in the low single digits. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to grow between 9% and 12% in constant currency, or US$14.9 billion to US$15.3 billion. Windows OEM revenue growth should be relatively flat, roughly in line with the PC market. In Windows commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive revenue growth in the mid-single digits. As a reminder, our quarterly revenue growth can have variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Devices, revenue growth should be in the low to mid-single digits. Search and news advertising ex-TAC revenue growth should be in the mid to high-teens. This will be higher than overall Search and news advertising revenue growth, which we expect to be in the low single digits. And in Gaming, we expect revenue growth in the mid-30s, including approximately 40 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the low to mid-50s, driven by the net impact from the Activision acquisition. Hardware revenue will again decline year-over-year. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS between US$19.95 billion to US$20.15 billion, including approximately $700 million from purchase accounting, integration, and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. We expect operating expense of US$15.2 billion to US$15.3 billion, including approximately $200 million from purchase accounting, integration, and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Other income and expense should be roughly negative $650 million driven by losses on investments accounted for under the equity method as interest income will be mostly offset by interest expense. As a reminder, we are required to recognize gains or losses on our equity investments, which can increase quarterly volatility. We expect our Q1 effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. In closing, we remain focused on delivering innovations that matter to our global customers of every size. That focus extends to delivering on our financial commitments as well. We delivered operating margin growth of nearly three points year-over-year even as we accelerated our AI investments, completed the Activision acquisition, and had a headwind from the change of useful lives last year. So, as we begin FY2025, we will continue to invest in the cloud and AI opportunity ahead aligned, and if needed adjusted, to the demand signals we see. We are committed to growing our leadership across our commercial cloud and within that, the AI platform, and we feel well positioned as we start FY2025. With that, let's go to Q&A, Brett.
Brett Iversen: Thanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Keith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you, guys for taking the question and congratulations on another great quarter and really solid overall fiscal year. Right now, there's a industry debate raging around the CapEx requirements around Generative AI and whether the monetization is actually going to match with that. And I think the question for you guys, from a Microsoft perspective, is CapEx still an appropriate leading indicator for cloud growth? Or does the shift in gross margin profile change that equation? Or said another way, maybe can you give us a little bit more help in understanding the timing between the CapEx investments and the yield on those investments? Thank you.
Satya Nadella: Thank you, Keith. Let me start, and then Amy can add to this. I think, I would say we primarily start right now from the demand side. What I mean by that is what's the product – shape of the product portfolio, what we learned even from the cloud transition, which, as you know, Keith, was similar in the sense it was both a knowledge-intensive and a capital-intensive transition. We needed to have the product portfolio where there was the right mix of, I'll call it, infrastructure meters as well as SaaS applications. So that's the first thing that we are looking at. And how is that value landing with customers and what's the growth rate. So when I think about what's happening with M365 Copilot as perhaps the best Office 365 or M365 suite we have had, the fact that we're getting recurring customers, so our customers coming back buying more seats. So GitHub Copilot now being bigger than even GitHub when we bought it. What's happening in the contact center with Dynamics. So I would say – and obviously, the Azure AI growth, that's the first place we look at. That then drives bulk of the CapEx spend, basically, that's the demand signal because you got to remember, even in the capital spend, there is land and there is data center build, but 60-plus percent is the kit, that only will be bought for inferencing and everything else if there is demand signal, right? So that's, I think, the key way to think about capital cycle even. The asset, as Amy said, is a long-term asset, which is land and the data center, which, by the way, we don't even construct things fully, we can even have things which are semi-constructed, we call [cold] (ph) shelves and so on. So we know how to manage our CapEx spend to build out a long-term asset and a lot of the hydration of the kit happens when we have the demand signal. There is definitely spend for training. Even there, of course, we will only be scaling training as we see the demand accrue in any given period in time. So I would say it's more important to manage, to capture the opportunity with the right product portfolio that's driving value. And on that front, I feel good about the breadth of Microsoft offering, whether it's in consumer side, whether it's on commercial per seat side or on the consumption meters, that's, I think, the fundamental driver.
Amy Hood: And Keith, I do think – and I really do appreciate how you phrased the question as well because I think the timing and some of the questions you all have had really led to how we were talking even about capital expense in our comments – in my comments today. Being able to maybe share a little more about that when we talked about roughly half of FY2024's total capital expense as well as half of Q4's expense, it's really on land and build and finance leases, and those things really will be monetized over 15 years and beyond. And they're incredibly flexible because we've built a consistent architecture first with the Commercial Cloud and second with the Azure stack for AI, regardless of whether the demand at the platform layer or at the app layer or through third parties and partners or, frankly, our first-party SaaS, it uses the same infrastructure. So it's long-lived flexible assets. And if you think about it, that way, you can see what we're doing and focused on is building out this network in parallel across the globe. Because when we did this last transition, the first transition to the Cloud, which seems a long time ago sometimes, it rolled out quite differently. We rolled out more geo by geo and this one because we have demand on a global basis. We are doing it on a global basis, which is important. We have large customers in every geo. And so hopefully, with that sort of shape of our capital expense, it helps people see how much of that is sort of near-term monetization driver as well as a much longer duration.
Keith Weiss: That's super helpful. Thank you very much.
Brett Iversen: Thanks, Keith. Operator, next question please.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.
Mark Moerdler: Thank you very much. Thank you for taking the question. And congrats on a strong year. GenAI has been a bit of rollercoaster of a tech over the last year with periods of acceleration, high expectations and the expectations drop as reality kicked in. With Azure growth we've seen this quarter and O365 Commercial, not yet fully visible in numbers even though Amy, you gave us a lot of color on it. Two quick parts to the question. Satya, how should we think about what it's going to take for GenAI to become more real across the industry and for it to become more visible within your SaaS offerings? And Amy, with Cloud, it took time for margins to improve. It looks like with AI, it's happening quicker. Can you give us a sense of how you think about the margin impact near-term and long-term from all the investment on AI? Thank you.
Satya Nadella: Yes. Thanks again, Mark, for the question. So to me, look, at the end of the day, GenAI is just software. So it is really translating into fundamentally growth on what has been our M365 SaaS offering with a newer offering that is the Copilot SaaS offering, which today is on a growth rate that's faster than any other previous generation of software we launched as a suite in M365. That's, I think, the best way to describe it. I mean the numbers I think we shared even this quarter are indicative of this, Mark. So if you look at it, we have both the landing of the seats itself quarter-over-quarter that is growing 60%, right? That's a pretty good healthy sign. The most healthy sign for me is the fact that customers are coming back there. That is the same customers with whom we landed the seats coming back and buying more seats. And then the number of customers with 10,000-plus seats doubled, right? It's 2x quarter-over-quarter. That, to me, is a healthy SaaS core business. And on top of that, some of the things that Amy shared around Dynamic. That's another exciting place for us, which is one, we are gaining share. We are – Dynamics with the GenAI built-in is sort of really biz app, it's probably the category that gets completely transformed with GenAI. Contact centers being a great example. We ourselves are on course to save hundreds of millions of dollars in our own customer support and contact center operations. I think we can drive that value to our customers. And then on the Azure side, you see the numbers very clearly. In fact, I think last quarter is when we started giving you that. You saw an acceleration of that this quarter. One of the other pieces, Mark, is AI doesn't sit on its own, right? So it's just for – we have a concept of design wins in Azure. So in fact, 50% of the folks who are using Azure AI are also using a data meter. That's very exciting to us because the most important thing in Azure is to win workloads in the enterprise. And that is starting to happen. And these are generational things once they get going with you. So that's, I think, how we think about it at least when I look at what's happening on our demand side.
Amy Hood: And, Mark, to answer the second half of your question on margin improvement, looking different than it did through the last cloud cycle. That's primarily for a reason I've mentioned a couple of times. We have a consistent platform. So because we're building to one Azure AI stack, we don't have to have multiple infrastructure investments. We're making one. We're using that internally first-party, and that's what we're using with customers to build on as well as ISVs. So it does, in fact, make margins start off better and obviously scale consistently.
Mark Moerdler: Thank you.
Brett Iversen: Thanks, Mark. Operator, next question please.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Kasthuri Rangan: Hi. Thank you very much and congrats on a great year – fiscal year ending. A question for you, Amy. When you look at the CapEx, how do you ring efficiencies out of the CapEx? You've disclosed that 50% of the infrastructure, the other 50% tech, is very useful. So in other words, do you have to keep growing CapEx at these elevated rates? Or could you slow down CapEx and still get that consistent revenue growth rate in your Azure and Generative AI? That's the main question in my mind? Thank you so much.
Amy Hood: Thanks, Kash. That's a very good question. There's really two pieces, I think, as I heard your question that I would reflect on. The first is, could we see sort of consistent revenue growth without maybe what you would say is more of this sort of elevated capital expense number or something that continues to accelerate. And the answer to that is yes because there's two different pieces, right? You're seeing half of this go toward long-term builds that Satya mentioned, the pace at which we fill those builds with CPUs or GPUs will be demand-driven. And so if we see differences in demand signal, we can throttle that investment on the CPU side, which we've done for I guess, a long time at this point, as I reflect, and we'll use all that same learning and demand signal understand to do the same thing on the GPU side. And so you're right that you could see relatively consistent revenue patterns and yet see these inconsistencies and capital spend quarter-to-quarter. The other thing, I would note, Kash, is you'll also notice there's a growing distinction between our CapEx number, and on occasion, the cash that we pay for PP&E and you're going to start to see that more often in this period because it happens when we use leases. Leases sort of show up all at once. And so you'll see a little bit more volatility. I've mentioned it back in my comments before, but I mentioned it again just because you're starting to see that distinction in my comments and hopefully that's helpful context.
Satya Nadella: Just one other thing, Amy, if I wanted to add. I think as people think about capital spend, I think it's important to separate out leases from build. And when it comes to build, I think it's important for us to think about – we think about it in terms of what's the total percentage of cost that goes into each line item, land which obviously has a very different duration and a very different lead time. So those are the other two considerations. We think about lead time and duration of the asset. Land, network, construction, the system or the kit and then the ongoing cost. And so if you think about it that way, then you know how to even adjust, if you will, the capital spend based on demand signal.
Kasthuri Rangan: Thank you. It was triggered by the jump in CapEx. And as Amy pointed out, you're guiding to accelerating Azure revenue growth rate, which, I guess, follows the CapEx surge. Thank you so much once again.
Brett Iversen: Thanks, Kash. Operator, next question please.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed.
Brent Thill: Thanks. Amy, the magnitude to beat this quarter was a little lower than we've seen in the past. Was there anything unusual on sales cycle that close rates that you saw? Thanks.
Amy Hood: Thanks, Brent. Actually, no. As I was talking on the quarter, I mean Commercial bookings were much better than we expected going into the quarter. Commitments were very good execution across both the core sort of annuity renewal motion was good, as expected, the larger long-term commitments were better than we expected. So Brent, I would not say there was anything really unusual in how I thought about what we saw in our commercial execution through the quarter.
Brent Thill: Great. Thank you.
Brett Iversen: Thanks, Brent. Operator, next question please.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed.
Karl Keirstead: Okay. Great. So maybe I'll direct this to Amy. Amy, I know when you set your Azure guidance, you're always looking to meet or beat the high-end. The 30% you put up in the June quarter, amazing number given the scale of Azure, but it did come in at the low end of your range. And I'd just love for you to maybe elaborate on the delta. I guess as I reflect on what you said in your comments. There's two things that I heard you say. One, it sounded like there's persistent capacity constraints that you think might get alleviated in the second half? And then secondly, you mentioned perhaps some modest softness in Europe. I presume that's a little bit more economic rather than Azure specific. Is that the right way to frame the performance in the quarter? Thank you.
Amy Hood: Thanks, Karl. Yes, that's exactly right. Maybe I'll just repeat it, just so people can hear it in my words as well to that 30% to 31% guide for Q4 and coming in at the lower end of 30%. You're exactly right. The distinguishing between being at the higher end or at the lower end, really was some softness we saw in a few European geos on non-AI consumption really made the difference in that number. And we've assumed that going forward into H1 inclusive of my guide 28% to 29% going forward. And then let me separate which was your larger point, which is what are the other factors you see ongoing. Number one, you're right, capacity constraints, particularly on AI and Azure will remain in Q4 and will remain in H1. So hopefully, that's helpful.
Karl Keirstead: Yes. Thank you, Amy.
Brett Iversen: Thanks, Karl. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Brad Zelnick: Great. Thank you very much. Amy, with Azure demand, once again greater than available capacity, I appreciate the CapEx investments and the build-out and acceleration you expect in the back half. But as we think about Cloud capacity and AI services specifically, can you talk about both the near-term and long-term strategy around the AI partnerships that you're signing with the likes of Oracle and Cohere, for example? Thank you.
Amy Hood: Thanks, Brad. Maybe separate a couple of things. We are – and we've talked about now for quite a few quarters, we are constrained on AI capacity. And because of that, actually, we've, to your point, have signed up with third parties to help us as we are behind with some leases on AI capacity. We've done that with partners who are happy to help us extend the Azure platform, to be able to serve this Azure AI demand. And you do see us investing quite a bit as we've talked about in builds so that we can get back in a more balanced place.
Satya Nadella: Yes. I mean, to me, it's no different than leases that we would have done in the past. These – you could even say sometimes buying from Oracle, maybe even more efficient leases because they're even shorter date.
Brad Zelnick: Excellent. Thanks for the color.
Brett Iversen: Thanks, Brad. Operator, next question please.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Mark Murphy: Thank you very much. With a couple of quarters of Copilot for M365 availability under your belt now, how are you assessing the capability of Copilots to replicate the productivity gains that they've created for developers, which seem to be very high and to do something similar for the broader population of knowledge workers? For instance, you're mentioning the 10,000 feet deals, the repeat purchases, is it possible to eventually see Copilot penetration rate equally high in office as they will be in GitHub?
Satya Nadella: Yes, that's a great question. In fact, the GitHub design system and the GitHub Copilot workspace design system, which now, for example, you start with an issue, you create a plan, from a plan, you create a spec, or you create a spec and from a spec, you create a plan and then you go operate across the full repo. That's effectively the design system that is getting replicated inside of even the M365 Copilot. And you see this even now – for example, you get an email, you're in sales, you want to respond to the customer. The data from the email is essentially context for a prompt but you expand by bringing in all of your CRM data, right? So this customer email is in the context of some order, all of the CRM record gets completed in context and a reply gets generated with the CRM data. That's the type of stuff that's already happening. Then you take something like Copilot Studio, you can start even grounding it in more data and then completing workflows. So you could say if this email comes from this customer whose order date is got a particular issue with it. You can then go and escalate it to somebody else who gets a notification in Teams. And those are the kinds of workflows that are getting built within IT or by end users themselves, what used to be line of business applications to us are Copilot extensions going forward. So we think of this as really a new design system for knowledge and frontline work to drive productivity, which would be very akin to what has happened in software engineering. So when you think about marketing or finance or sales or customer service, we will effectively replicate what you just said, which is the type of productivity we've seen in developers, will come to all of these functions as they think about their work, workflow and workout effect, all being driven by Copilots.
Mark Murphy: Thank you very much.
Brett Iversen: Thanks, Mark. Operator, we have time for one last question.
Operator: And the last question will come from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Keith Bachman: Hi. Good evening, and thank you for the opportunity to ask the question. I actually wanted to veer towards gaming, if I could, for a second. Xbox content services revenue grew 61%, 58 points held from Activision. So net is about 3 points of growth. How should investors think about the longer-term growth potential in this area? You've made significant investments, including the Activision deal. But how should investors be thinking about the growth potential of the gaming? Or what are the puts and takes to help make considerations here? Thank you.
Satya Nadella: Yes. For us, our investment in gaming fundamentally was to have, I would say, the right portfolio of both what we love about gaming and always have loved about gaming, which is Xbox and the content for the console and expand from there so that we have content for everywhere people play games, starting with the PC. So when I think about the Activision portfolio, it comes with great assets for us to cover both the PC and the console. And then, of course, assets to cover mobile sockets, which we never have. So we feel that now we have both the content and the ability to access all the traditional high scale platforms where people play games, which is the console, PC and mobile. But we're also excited about these new sockets, right? I mean the fact that even in this last quarter, we expanded X Cloud to Amazon TV, I forget the name of what it's called. But that's the type of new access that really helps us a lot, get reach new gamers or the same gamer everywhere they want to play. And that ultimately will show up in that software plus services and transaction revenue for us, which is really our long-term KPI, and that's what we're building towards. And that was strategy behind Activision as an asset. Amy, if you want to add to it?
Amy Hood: No. I do think the real goal here is to be able to take a broad set of content to more users in more places, and really build what looks more like to us, the software annuity and subscription business. With enhanced transactions and the ownership of IP, which is quite valuable long-term. As Satya mentioned, things where with the ownership of IP, it can be monetized in multiple ways. And I think we're really encouraged by some of the progress and how we're making progress with Game Pass as well with some of the new announcements. Thank you, Keith.
Brett Iversen: Thanks, Keith. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon.
Amy Hood: Thank you.
Satya Nadella: Thank you all.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.",2024-07-30
MSFT,2025,1,2025-Q1-MSFT,"Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Microsoft Fiscal Year 2025 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Brett Iversen, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Brett Iversen: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Alice Jolla, Chief Accounting Officer; and Keith Dolliver, Corporate Secretary and Deputy General Counsel. On the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provides the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. We have recast certain prior period amounts to reflect the FY '25 changes to the composition of our segments announced in August 2024. Additional details, including FY '23 and FY '24 recast segment revenue, operating income and product and service level revenue can be found in the financial statements filed on the Investor Relations website. More detailed outlook slides will also be available on the Microsoft Investor Relations website when we provide outlook commentary on today's call. On this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP items. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the Company's first quarter performance in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results. All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are the same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rate only. We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript, and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website. During this call, we'll be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.
Satya Nadella: Thank you, Brett. We are off to a solid start to our fiscal year, driven by continued strength of Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $38.9 billion in revenue, up 22%. AI-driven transformation is changing work, work artifacts and workflow across every role, function, and business process, helping customers drive new growth and operating leverage. All up, our AI business is on track to surpass an annual revenue run rate of $10 billion next quarter, which will make it the fastest business in our history to reach this milestone. Now I'll highlight examples of our progress starting with infrastructure. Azure took share this quarter. We are seeing continued growth in cloud migration. Azure Arc now has over 39,000 customers across every industry, including American Tower, CTT, L'Oréal, up more than 80% year-over-year. We now have data centers in over 60 regions around the world. And this quarter, we announced new cloud and AI infrastructure investments in Brazil, Italy, Mexico, and Sweden as we expand our capacity in line with our long-term demand signals. At the silicon layer, our new Cobalt 100 VMs are being used by companies like Databricks, Elastic, Siemens, Snowflake, and Synopsys to power their general-purpose workloads at up to 50% better price performance than previous generations. On top of this, we are building out our next-generation AI infrastructure, innovating across the full stack to optimize our fleet for AI workloads. We offer the broadest selection of AI accelerators, including our first-party accelerator, Maia 100 as well as the latest GPUs from AMD and NVIDIA. In fact, we are the first cloud to bring up NVIDIA's Blackwell system with GB200-powered AI servers. Our partnership with OpenAI also continues to deliver results. We have an economic interest in a company that has grown significantly in value, and we have built differentiated IP and are driving revenue momentum. More broadly with Azure AI, we are building an end-to-end app platform to help customers build their own Copilots and agents. Azure OpenAI usage more than doubled over the past six months as both digital natives like Grammarly and Harvey as well as established enterprises like Bajaj Finance, Hitachi, KT, and LG move apps from test to production. GE Aerospace, for example, used Azure OpenAI to build a new digital assistant for all 52,000 of its employees. In just three months, it has been used to conduct over 500,000 internal queries and process more than 200,000 documents. And this quarter, we added support for OpenAI's newest model family, o1. We're also bringing industry-specific models through Azure AI, including a collection of best-in-class multimodal models for medical imaging. And with the GitHub models, we now provide access to our full model catalog directly within the GitHub developer workflow. Azure AI is also increasingly an on-ramp to our data and analytics services. As developers build new AI apps on Azure, we have seen an acceleration of Azure Cosmos DB and Azure SQL DB hyperscale usage as customers like Air India, Novo Nordisk, Telefonica, Toyota Motors North America, and Uniper take advantage of capabilities, purpose-built for AI applications. And with Microsoft Fabric, we provide a single AI-powered platform to help customers like Chanel, EY, KPMG, Swiss Air, and Syndigo unify their data across clouds. We now have over 16,000 paid Fabric customers, over 70% of the Fortune 500. Now on to developers. GitHub Copilot is changing the way the world builds software. Copilot enterprise customers increased 55% quarter-over-quarter as companies like AMD and Flutter Entertainment tailor Copilot to their own code base. And we are introducing the next phase of AI code generation, making GitHub Copilot agentic across the developer workflow. GitHub Copilot Workspace is a developer environment which leverages agents from start to finish so developers can go from spec to plan to code all in natural language. Copilot Auto Fix is an AI agent that helps developers at companies like Asurion and Auto Group fix vulnerabilities in their code over 3x faster than it would take them on their own. We're also continuing to build on GitHub's open platform ethos by making more models available via GitHub Copilot. And we are expanding the reach of GitHub to a new segment of developers introducing GitHub Spark, which enables anyone to build apps in natural language. Already, we have brought generative AI to Power Platform to help customers use low-code, no-code tools to cut costs and development time. To date, nearly 600,000 organizations have used AI-powered capabilities in Power Platform, up 4x year-over-year. Citizen developers at ZF, for example, built apps simply by describing what they need using natural language. And this quarter, we introduced new ways for customers to apply AI to streamline complex workflows with Power Automate. Now on to work. We launched the next wave of Microsoft 365 Copilot innovation last month, bringing together Web, Work, and Pages as the new design system for knowledge work. Pages is the first new digital artifact for the AI age, and it's designed to help you ideate with AI and collaborate with other people. We've also made Microsoft 365 Copilot responses 2x faster and improved response quality by nearly 3x. This innovation is driving accelerated usage, and the number of people using Microsoft 365 daily more than doubled quarter-over-quarter. We are also seeing increased adoption from customers in every industry as they use Microsoft 365 Copilot to drive real business value. Vodafone, for example, will roll out Microsoft 365 Copilot to 68,000 employees after a trial showed that, on average, they save three hours per person per week. And UBS will deploy 50,000 seats in our largest finserve deal to date. And we continue to see enterprise customers coming back to buy more seats. All up, nearly 70% of the Fortune 500 now use Microsoft 365 Copilot, and customers continue to adopt it at a faster rate than any other new Microsoft 365 suite. Copilot is the UI for AI and with Microsoft 365 Copilot, Copilot Studio and Agents and now Autonomous Agents, we have built an end-to-end system for AI business transformation. With Copilot Studio, organizations can build and connect Microsoft 365 Copilot to Autonomous Agents, which then delegate to Copilot when there is an exception. More than 100,000 organizations from Ensure, Standard Bank, and Thomson Reuters, to Virgin Money and Zurich Insurance have used Copilot Studio to date, up over 2x quarter-over-quarter. More broadly, we are seeing AI drive a fundamental change in the business applications market as customers shift from legacy apps to AI-first business processes. Dynamics 365 continues to take share as organizations like Evron, Heineken, and Lexmark chose our apps over other providers. And monthly active users of Copilot across our CRM and ERP portfolio increased over 60% quarter-over-quarter. Our Dynamics 365 contact center is also winning customers like Curry's, Le Creuset, and RXO as it brings generative AI to every customer engagement channel. And just last week, we added 10 out-of-the-box autonomous agents to Dynamics 365 that helps customers automatically qualify sales leads, track suppliers and work hand-in-hand with service reps to resolve issues. We're also bringing AI to industry-specific workflows. One year in, DAX Copilot is now documenting over 1.3 million physician patient encounters each month at over 500 health care organizations like Baptist Medical Group, Baylor Scott & White, Baltimore Medical Center, Novant Health, and Overlake Medical Center. It is showing faster revenue growth than GitHub Copilot did in this first year. And new features extend DAX beyond notes helping physicians automatically draft referrals after visit instructions and diagnostic evidence. On top of all this AI innovation, Microsoft Teams usage remains at all-time highs as people use it to streamline all their communications. Nearly 75% of our Teams Enterprise customers now buy Premium, Phone, or Rooms. When it comes to Windows, our new class of Copilot+ PCs is winning new customers. They offer best-in-class AI capability, performance, and value. AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm now all support Copilot+ PCs. This quarter, we also introduced new AI experience only available on Copilot+ PCs like Click to Do, which places an interactive overlay over your desktop to suggest next best actions. And as we approach the end of support for Windows 10 a year from now, we are well positioned to transition our customers to Windows 11, ensuring they benefit from enhanced features and security improvements we've introduced over the past few years. Now on to security. We continue to prioritize security above all else. With our Secure Future Initiative, we have dedicated the equivalent of 34,000 full-time engineers to address the highest-priority security tasks. We have made significant progress to better protect tenants' identities, networks, and engineering systems, and we have created new processes to ensure security is prioritized at every level of the Company. And we continue to take what we learn and turn it into innovations across our products. Security Copilot, for example, is being used by companies in every industry, including Clifford Chance, Intesa Sanpaolo, and Shell to perform SecOps tasks faster and more accurately. And we are now helping customers protect their AI deployments too. Customers have used Defender or Discover and secured more than 750,000 gen AI app instances and used Purview to audit over one billion Copilot interactions to meet their compliance obligations. And all up, we continue to take share across all major categories we serve and are consistently recognized by top analysts as a leader in 20 categories, more than any other vendor. Now let me turn to our consumer businesses, starting with LinkedIn. Member growth continues to accelerate with markets in India and Brazil both growing at double digits. We are also seeing record engagement as we introduce new ways for our more than 1 billion members to connect, sell services, get hired, and share knowledge. Our investments in rich formats like video strengthened our leadership in B2B advertising and amplified the value we deliver to our customers. Weekly immersive video views increased 6x quarter-over-quarter, and total video viewership on LinkedIn is up 36% year-over-year. Our AI-powered tools also continue to transform how people sell, learn and hire. In sales, new AI features help every team member perform at the level of top sellers and drive more profitable growth. In Learning, just yesterday, we announced updates to our coaching experience, including personalized career development plans. LinkedIn's first agent hiring assistant will help hirers find qualified candidates faster by tackling the most time-consuming task. Already hirers who use AI Assistant messages see a 44% higher acceptance rate compared to those who don't. And our hiring business continues to take share. Now on to search, advertising, and news. With Copilot, we are seeing the first step towards creating a new AI companion for everyone with new Copilot experience we introduced earlier this month includes a refreshed design and tone along with improved speed and fluency across the web and mobile. And it includes advanced capabilities like voice and vision that make it more delightful and useful and feel more natural. You can both browse and converse with Copilot simultaneously because Copilot sees what you see. More broadly, AI is also transforming search, browsers, and digital advertising, and we continue to take share across Bing and Edge. Bing ex-TAC revenue growth outpaced the search market. Now on to gaming. One year since we closed our acquisition of Activision Blizzard King, we are focused on building a business positioned for long-term growth, driven by higher-margin content and services. You already see this transformation in our results as we diversify the ways that gamers access our content. We set new records for monthly active users in the quarter as more players than ever play our games across devices and on the Xbox platform. Game Pass also set a new Q1 record for total revenue and average revenue per subscriber. And as we look ahead, our IP across our studios has never been stronger. Last week's launch of Black Ops 6 was the biggest Call of Duty release ever, setting a record for day one players as well as Game Pass subscriber ads on launch day. And unit sales on PlayStation and Steam were also up over 60% year-over-year. This speaks to our strategy of meeting gamers where they are by enabling them to play more games across the screens, they spend their time on. In closing, we are rapidly innovating to expand our opportunity across our commercial and consumer businesses. In three weeks' time, we will hold our Ignite conference, and I look forward to sharing more then about how we are helping every business function use AI to drive growth in this new era. With that, let me turn it over to Amy.
Amy Hood: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $65.6 billion, up 16%, and earnings per share was $3.30, an increase of 10%. With strong execution by our sales teams and partners, we delivered a solid start to our fiscal year with double-digit top and bottom-line growth. We also saw continued share gains across many of our businesses. In our commercial business, increased demand and growth in long-term commitments to our Microsoft Cloud platform drove our results. Commercial bookings were ahead of expectations and increased 30% and 23% in constant currency. Results were driven by strong execution across our core annuity sales motions and growth in the number of $10 million-plus contracts for both Azure and Microsoft 365. Additionally, we also saw an increase in the number of $100 million-plus contracts for Azure. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 22% and 21% in constant currency to $259 billion. Roughly 40% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 17% year-over-year. The remaining portion, recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 27%. And this quarter, our annuity mix increased to 98%. In addition to commercial results that were in line with expectations, we also saw some benefit from in-period revenue recognition across Microsoft 365 commercial, Azure, and our on-premises server business. At a company level, Activision contributed a net impact of approximately 3 points to revenue growth, with a 2-point drag on operating income growth and had a negative $0.05 impact to earnings per share. A reminder that this net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from our prior relationship as a third-party partner to first-party and includes $911 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration, and transaction-related costs. FX did not have a significant impact on our results and was roughly in line with expectations on total company revenue, segment-level revenue, COGS, and operating expense growth. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $38.9 billion and grew 22%, roughly in line with expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased 2 points year-over-year to 71%. This was slightly better than expected due to improvement in Azure, although the gross margin percentage decrease year-over-year continues to be driven by scaling our AI infrastructure. Company gross margin dollars increased 13% and 14% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage was 69%, down 2 points year-over-year, driven by the lower Microsoft Cloud gross margin noted earlier as well as the impact from purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Operating expenses increased 12%, lower than expected due to our focus on cost efficiencies and ongoing prioritization work. Operating expense growth included 9 points from the Activision acquisition. At a total company level, headcount at the end of September was 8% higher than a year ago. Excluding the growth of the Activision acquisition, headcount was 2% higher. Operating income increased 14% and operating margins were 47%, down 1 point year-over-year. Excluding the net impact from the Activision acquisition, operating margins were up 1 point as we continue to drive efficiencies across our businesses as we invest in AI infrastructure and capabilities. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $28.3 billion and grew 12% and 13% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected results across all businesses. M365 commercial cloud revenue increased 15% and 16% in constant currency with business trends that were as expected. The better-than-expected result was due to a small benefit from the in-period revenue recognition noted earlier. ARPU growth was primarily driven by E5 as well as M365 Copilot. Paid M365 commercial seats grew 8% year-over-year with installed base expansion across all customer segments. Seat growth was driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings. M365 commercial cloud revenue represents nearly 90% of total M365 commercial products and cloud services. M365 commercial products revenue increased 2% and 3% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, primarily due to the benefit from in-period revenue recognition noted earlier. M365 consumer products and cloud services revenue increased 5% and 6% in constant currency. M365 consumer cloud revenue increased 6% and 7% in constant currency, with continued momentum in M365 consumer subscriptions, which grew 10% to 84.4 million. M365 consumer cloud revenue represents 85% of total M365 consumer products and cloud services. LinkedIn revenue increased 10% and 9% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations with growth across all lines of business. Dynamics revenue grew 14%, driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 18% and 19% in constant currency with continued growth across all workloads and continued share gains. As a reminder, Dynamics 365 represents about 90% of total Dynamics revenue. Segment gross margin dollars increased 11% and 12% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year, driven by scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 2% and operating income increased 16%. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $24.1 billion, increasing 20% and 21% in constant currency, in line with expectations. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 33% and 34% in constant currency, with healthy consumption trends that were in line with expectations. The better-than-expected result was due to the small benefit from in-period revenue recognition noted earlier. Azure growth included roughly 12 points from AI services, similar to last quarter. Demand continues to be higher than our available capacity. Non-AI growth trends were also in line with expectations in total and across regions as customers continued to migrate and modernize on the Azure platform. The non-AI point contribution to Azure growth was sequentially lower by approximately 1 point. In our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 1%. Lower-than-expected transactional purchasing ahead of the Windows Server 2025 launch as well as lower purchasing of licenses running a multi-cloud environment was mostly offset by the benefit from in-period revenue recognition noted earlier. Enterprise and partner services revenue decreased 1% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars increased 15%, and gross margin percentage decreased 3 points year-over-year, driven by scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 8% and operating income grew 18%. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue of $13.2 billion increasing 17% with 15 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Results were above expectations, driven by gaming and search. Windows OEM and devices revenue increased 2% year-over-year as better-than-expected results in Windows OEM due to mix shift to higher monetizing markets was partially offset by the lower-than-expected results in devices due to execution challenges in the commercial segment. Search and news advertising revenue ex-TAC increased 18% and 19% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, primarily due to continued execution improvement. We saw rate expansion in addition to healthy volume growth in both Edge and Bing. And in gaming, revenue increased 43% and 44% in constant currency with 43 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Results were ahead of expectations, driven by stronger-than-expected performance in both first- and third-party content as well as consoles. Xbox content and services revenue increased 61% with 53 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Segment gross margin dollars increased 16% and 17% in constant currency with 12 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged year-over-year. Our strong execution on margin improvement in gaming and search was offset by sales mix shift to those businesses. Operating expenses increased 49% with 51 points from the Activision acquisition. Operating income decreased 4%. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $20 billion, in line with expectations, and cash paid for PP&E was $14.9 billion. Roughly half of our cloud and AI-related spend continues to be for long-lived assets that will support monetization over the next 15 years and beyond. The remaining cloud and AI spend is primarily for servers, both CPUs and GPUs, to serve customers based on demand signals. Cash flow from operations was $34.2 billion, up 12%, driven by strong cloud billings and collections, partially offset by higher supplier employee and tax payments. Free cash flow was $19.3 billion, down 7% year-over-year, reflecting higher capital expenditures to support our cloud and AI offerings. This quarter, other income expense was negative $283 million, significantly more favorable than anticipated due to foreign currency remeasurement and net gains on investments. Our losses on investments accounted for under the equity method were as expected. Our effective tax rate was approximately 19%. And finally, we returned $9 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Now moving to our Q2 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S. dollar basis. First, FX. With the weaker U.S. dollar and assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to increase total revenue and segment level revenue growth by less than 1 point. We expect FX to have no meaningful impact to COGS or operating expense growth. Our outlook has many of the trends we saw in Q1 continue through Q2. Customer demand for our differentiated solutions should drive another quarter of strong growth. In commercial bookings, we expect strong growth on a growing expiry base driven by increased long-term commitments to our platform and strong execution across core annuity sales motions. As a reminder, larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, can drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly 70%, down year-over-year, driven by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure. We expect capital expenditures to increase on a sequential basis, given our cloud and AI demand signals. As I said last quarter, we will stay aligned and, if needed, adjust to the demand signals we see. As a reminder, there can be quarterly spend variability from cloud infrastructure build-outs and the timing of delivery of finance leases. Next, segment guidance, starting with Productivity and Business Processes. We are the market leader when it comes to knowledge-based Copilots and agents in the enterprise space, and we are focused on continuing to gain share across our productivity solutions. Therefore, we expect revenue in Productivity and Business Processes to grow between 10% and 11% in constant currency or $28.7 billion to $29 billion. M365 commercial cloud revenue growth should be approximately 14% in constant currency with moderating seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5 and M365 Copilot. For H2, we expect revenue growth to remain relatively stable compared to Q2. We continue to see growth in M365 Copilot seats, and we expect the related revenue to continue to grow gradually over time. For M365 commercial products, we expect revenue to decline in the low single digits. As a reminder, M365 commercial products include on-premises components of M365 suites. So, our quarterly revenue growth can have variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. M365 consumer cloud revenue growth should be in the mid-single digits driven by M365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth of approximately 10%, driven by continued growth across all businesses. And in Dynamics 365, we expect revenue growth to be in the mid- to high teens, driven by continued growth across all workloads. Next, Intelligent Cloud. Helping our customers transform and grow with innovative cloud and AI solutions is driving continued growth in Azure. Therefore, we expect revenue in Intelligent Cloud to grow between 18% and 20% in constant currency or $25.55 billion to $25.85 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q2 revenue growth to be 31% to 32% in constant currency, driven by strong demand for our portfolio of services. We expect consumption growth to be stable compared to Q1, and we expect to add more sequential dollars to Azure than any other quarter in history. We expect the contribution from AI services to be similar to last quarter, given the continued capacity constraints as well as some capacity that shifted out of Q2. And in H2, we still expect Azure growth to accelerate from H1 as our capital investments create an increase in available AI capacity to serve more of the growing demand. And in our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline in the low to mid-single digits on a prior year comparable that benefited from purchasing ahead of Windows Server 2012 end of support. And in Enterprise and partner services, we expect revenue growth to be in the low single digits. Now to More Personal Computing. We continue to make decisions to prioritize strategic higher-margin opportunities within each of our consumer businesses. Our outlook reflects the improvement in gross and operating margins from this prioritization work across gaming, search, and devices. We expect revenue in More Personal Computing to be $13.85 billion to $14.25 billion. Windows OEM and devices revenue should decline in the low to mid-single digits. We expect Windows OEM revenue growth in line with the PC market to be more than offset by a decline in devices as the trends from Q1 continue. Search and news advertising ex-TAC revenue growth should be in the high teens, with continued growth in both volume and revenue per search. This will be higher than overall search and news advertising revenue growth, which we expect to be in the high single digits. And in gaming, we expect revenue to decline in the high single digits due to hardware. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth to be relatively flat. We're excited about last week's launch of Call of Duty, where we saw the most Game Pass subscriber adds we've ever seen on a launch day. There are two things about the launch that are different than the Call of Duty launch a year ago, where revenue was mostly recognized in the quarter of purchase. First, the game is available on Game Pass so for players who play through Game Pass, the subscription revenue is recognized over time. Second, the game requires an online connection to play so even for players who purchased the standalone game, revenue recognition will also occur ratably over time. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS to grow between 11% and 13% in constant currency or to be between $21.9 billion to $22.1 billion, and operating expense to grow approximately 7% in constant currency or to be between $16.4 billion and $16.5 billion. This should result in another quarter of operating margin expansion. Other income and expense is expected to be roughly negative $1.5 billion, primarily driven by our share of the expected loss from OpenAI, which is accounted for under the equity method. As a reminder, we do not recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on equity method investments. As you heard from Satya, our strategic partnership and investment in OpenAI has been pivotal in building and scaling our AI business and positioning us as the leader in the AI platform wave. And lastly, we expect our Q2 effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. In closing, we remain focused on strategically investing in the long-term opportunities that we believe drive shareholder value. Monetization from these investments continues to grow, and we're excited that only 2.5 years in, our AI business is on track to surpass $10 billion of annual revenue run rate in Q2. This will be the fastest business in our history to reach this milestone. We are committed to growing this leadership position across our entire Microsoft Cloud while maintaining our disciplined focus on cost management and prioritization across every team. With that, let's go to Q&A, Brett.
Brett Iversen: Thanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Keith Weiss: Congratulations on a really solid quarter. So, Satya, the expansion of capabilities, the speed of innovation, the magnitude of the opportunities ahead for generative AI makes this the most exciting period for software I've seen in my 25 years of covering this space. And based upon this call, it seems like you share that excitement. But in my investor conversation, that excitement also feeds two related questions, and they both have to do with constraints. And the first is like what are the internal constraints or guardrails that Microsoft has when it comes to investing behind these innovations, particularly in relation to the funding of future generations of foundational models, where people were talking about price tags, you want to spend the tens of billions or even $100 billion-plus? And then on the other side of the spectrum, what are the external constraints that Microsoft sees in building out this capacity to meet the demand and capture the opportunity, particularly constraints in your ability to power all these new data centers being built out and powered in an environmentally sustainable fashion? I'd love to get the Microsoft perspective on both those questions.
Satya Nadella: Thank you, Keith, for those questions. I think on the first point, ultimately, when you think about, let's say, capital outlay for training because that's essentially what you're asking, it is going to be rate limited by your monetization of inference, given generation, right? So just like in the past, we would allocate capital to build out cloud based on the demand signal we were seeing and then we would then project the demand, and that's what we would build for. So, you can think of training essentially as that, right, which is you're building the next-generation model so that then you have a more capable model that then drives more inference demand, right? So ultimately, even with all the scaling laws and what have you, I think you ultimately will normalize to having a pace. In fact, I think the best way to think about even is given that Moore's Law effectively is working on the sort of silicon and system size, so it's just not compute, right, it's efficiencies in compute, it's data as well as algorithms. You will want to sort of keep on that curve, which is you really want to refresh your fleet with the Moore's Law every year and then effectively depreciate it over the period of the life cycle of it. And then the inference demand ultimately will cover how much we invest in training because that's, I think, at the end of the day, you're all subject to ultimately demand. So, the second piece of the external constraints, we have run into, obviously, lots of external constraints because this demand all showed up pretty fast, right? I mean, if you think about even the most hit product of this generation all are in our cloud, right, whether it's ChatGPT, whether it's Copilot, whether it's GitHub Copilot or even DAX Copilot, I mean, pick the top four or five products of this generation, they're all sort of in and around our ecosystem. And so therefore, we ran into a set of constraints, which are everything because DCs don't get built overnight. So, there is DCs, there is power. And so that's sort of been the short-term constraint. Even in Q2, for example, some of the demand issues we have or our ability to fulfill demand is because of, in fact, external third-party stuff that we leased moving up. So that's the constraints we have. But in the long run, we do need effectively power and we need DCs. And some of these things are more long lead. But I feel pretty good that going into the second half of even this fiscal year, that some of that supply/demand will match up.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed.
Brent Thill: Amy, good to hear the reacceleration in the back half for Azure. I guess many are asking, 34% growth in Q1 falling to low 30s. I know the comp is a couple of points harder, but is there anything else you're contemplating in that guide for Q2 to see that deceleration other than a tougher comp?
Amy Hood: Thanks, Brent. Maybe this is a great question because I can sort of reiterate some of the points I made and tie them together a little bit. In Q1, the 34% in CC, as we talked about, that upside versus the 33% that we had guided to was primarily due to some revenue recognition benefits. And so, I think about that on a sort of a pure consumption basis and AI as being 33%. And you think about 1 point or 2 of decel that we've guided to, and the majority of that is due to, unfortunately, some supply pushouts that I mentioned and then Satya reiterated in terms of AI supply coming online that we counted on. The underlying consumption growth is stable Q1 to Q2. And so, to your question on some ins and outs, it is certainly some ins and outs. I do, as you heard, have confidence as we get a good influx of supply across the second half of the year, particularly on the AI side that we'll be better able to do some supply-demand matching and hence, while we're talking about acceleration in the back half. I'll also take the opportunity to say, when you see usage in AI workloads, we always intend to think about that as just a GPU exercise. The importance of having GPUs and CPUs be able to run these workloads is also important. So that's a piece of the acceleration in H2 as well.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein. Please proceed.
Mark Moerdler: Congratulations on the quarter. The question every investor obviously asks is a question on the CapEx growth and the CapEx spend. Obviously, half of that facility is an equivalent that have a longer life, but the other half is the rest of the components. Can you give any color on how you think of that growth? Does it return to the traditional approach, where basically CapEx is going to grow in line or slightly slower than cloud revenue? And if so, any sense of the timing? Do we have enough facilities online by sometime next year, et cetera? Any color would be appreciated.
Amy Hood: Thanks, Mark. I think in some ways, it's helpful to go back to the cloud transition that we worked on over a decade ago, I think, in the early stages. And what you did see and you'll see us do in the same time is you have to build to meet demand. Unlike the cloud transition, we're doing it on a global basis in parallel as opposed to sequential, given the nature of the demand. And then as long as we continue to see that demand grow, you're right, the growth in CapEx will slow and the revenue growth will increase. And those two things, to your point, get closer and closer together over time. The pace of that entirely depends really on the pace of adoption. And to Satya's point, some of that spend goes towards building the next training infrastructure so you won't see all of it in COGS. Some of it goes to OpEx when you're spending it on training. But in general, that's a healthy way to think about the balance as that over time those do and should like the last cycle get closer together.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed.
Karl Keirstead: I'm actually not going to ask a question about the numbers, but Satya and Amy, I'd love to ask a question about OpenAI. Since the print three months ago, we investors have been hit with a torrent of media stories about OpenAI and Microsoft. And I'd love to give Microsoft an opportunity to frame the relationship. It seems to me it's critically important. But we have been, I think, everyone on the line picking up signals that perhaps Microsoft wants to diversify somewhat at the model layer and offer customers choice. So, Satya, I'd love to get your framing of the relationship. And then in terms of the numbers, maybe this is a little bit more for you, Amy, but how does Microsoft manage the demands on CapEx from helping OpenAI with its scaling ambitions? And how do you manage the impact on other income that you just gave us some color on?
Satya Nadella: Sure. Thanks, Karl. So, I'd say first, the partnership for both sides, that's OpenAI and Microsoft, has been super beneficial. After all, we effectively sponsored what is one of the most highest-valued private companies today when we invested in them and really took a bet on them and their innovation four, five years ago. And that has led to great success for Microsoft. That's led to great success for OpenAI. And we continue to build on it, right? So, we serve them with world-class infrastructure on which they do their innovation in terms of models, on top of which we innovate on both the model layer with some of the post-training stuff we do as well as some of the small models we build. And then, of course, all of the product innovation, right? One of the things that my own sort of conviction of OpenAI and what they were doing came about when I started seeing something like GitHub Copilot as a product get built or DAX Copilot get built or M365 Copilot get built. So, we have a fantastic portfolio of innovation that we build on top of that. And the same also, I would say, we are investors. We feel very, very good about sort of our investment stake in OpenAI. And so, our focus, and we're always in constant dialogue with them in a partnership like this where both sides have achieved mutual success at the pace at which we've achieved it, that means we need to kind of push each other to do more, to capture the moment and that's what we plan to do, and we intend to keep building on it.
Amy Hood: And maybe to your other two questions, Karl, Listen, I'm thrilled with their success and need for supply from Azure and infrastructure and really what it's meant in terms of being able to also serve other customers for us. It's important that we continue to invest capital to meet not only their demand signal and needs for compute but also from our broader customers. That's partially why you've seen us committing the amount of capital we've seen over the past few quarters is our commitment to both grow together and for us to continue to grow the Azure platform for customers beyond them. And so, I don't really think of it as how do you balance it. It's just we have customers who have needs and real use cases and delivering value today. And if we can't meet that, we need to work to meet it. And that means working harder and faster to make sure we do that, which is what the team is committed to do. Second piece of your question, I think, was on the impact to other income. And not to get too accounting-heavy on the earnings phone call, but I would say just a reminder, this is under the equity method, which means we just take our percentage of losses every quarter. And those losses, of course, are capped by the amount of investment we make in total, which we did talk about in the Q this quarter as being $13 billion. And so over time, that's just the constraint and it's a bit of a mechanical entry. And so, I don't really think about managing that. That's the investment and acceleration that OpenAI is making in themselves and we take a percentage of that.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Kash Rangan: Satya, when you talked about the investment cycle, these models are getting bigger, more expensive, but you also pointed out to how the inference phase were likely to get paid. How does that cycle look like an inference for Microsoft? Where are the products and the applications that will show up on the Microsoft P&L as a result of the inference rate of AI kicking in?
Satya Nadella: Thanks, Kash. I mean, the good news for us is that we're not waiting for that inference to show up, right? If you sort of think about the point, we even made that this is going to be the fastest growth to $10 billion of any business in our history, it's all inference, right? One of the things that may not be as evident is that we're not actually selling raw GPUs for other people to train. In fact, that's sort of a business we turn away because we have so much demand on inference that we are not taking what I would -- in fact, there's a huge adverse selection problem today where people -- it's just a bunch of tech companies still using VC money to buy a bunch of GPUs. We kind of really are not even participating in most of that because we are literally going to the real demand, which is in the enterprise space or our own products like GitHub Copilot or M365 Copilot. So, I feel the quality of our revenue is also pretty superior in that context. And that's what gives us even the conviction, to even Amy's answers previously, about our capital spend is if this was just all about sort of a bunch of people training large models and that was all we got, then that would be ultimately still waiting, to your point, for someone to actually have demand which is real. And in our case, the good news here is we have a diversified portfolio. We're seeing real demand across all of that portfolio.
Amy Hood: And Kash, maybe just to add a little bit to what Satya is saying. I think a part of his two answers is that what you're seeing is this number we're talking about, the $10 billion across inference and our apps is already what that momentum and that investment and that progress and that revenue is what builds the next cycle of training, right? And so, it's that circle as opposed to, oh, we're doing training now and then inference. Much of the training investments that are -- that fuel this revenue growth came before and we already funded that work. And so, that's an important part.
Kash Rangan: That's, to your point, that you invest now and you can get the growth later, even if you slow down the CapEx, right, that's what you're trying to tell us?
Amy Hood: That's the cycle that is important to understand.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Mark Murphy: I'm wondering if you can shed any more light just on the nature of the supply limitations that you're mentioning that are impacting Azure in Q2, where that impact might be incrementally just a touch more than we expected? Is it more the GPU supply? Is there some element of power cooling or the ability to wire up the networks? And Amy, should we infer that the supply is constraining Azure growth by roughly a couple of few points in Q2 or am I overestimating that?
Amy Hood: Maybe to answer both those questions, Mark, very directly, I wouldn't think about it component logic in my Q2 answer. The supply pushout, as Satya said, was third parties that are delivering later than we had expected, that get pushed mainly into the second half of the year and in general, Q3. So that's third parties where we have tended to buy supply inclusive of kits so it's complete end-to-end third-party delivery. In terms of the impact, as I was saying, when you think about having flat consumption Q1 to Q2, there really are only two things that impact that difference and one was the help we got in Q1 from the revenue and accounting help, and then Q2 has been the supply pushout.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed.
Raimo Lenschow: If you talk about the market at the moment because you were first with Copilot, you had identified a lot with Copilots and now we're talking agents. Can you, kind of -- Satya, how do you think about that? And to me, it looks like an evolution that we're discovering how to kind of productize AI better, et cetera. So how do you think about that journey between Copilots, agents and maybe what's coming next?
Satya Nadella: Sure. The system we have built is Copilot, Copilot Studio, agents and autonomous agents. You should think of that as the spectrum of things, right? So ultimately, the way we think about how this all comes together is you need humans to be able to interface with AI. So, the UI layer for AI is Copilot. You can then use Copilot Studio to extend Copilot. For example, you want to connect it to your CRM system, to your office system, to your HR system. You do that through Copilot Studio by building agents effectively. You also build autonomous agents. So, you can use even that's the announcement we made a couple of weeks ago is you can even use Copilot Studio to build autonomous agents. Now these autonomous agents are working independently, but from time to time, they need to raise an exception, right? So autonomous agents are not fully autonomous because at some point, they need to either notify someone or have someone input something. And when they need to do that, they need a UI layer and that's where again, it's Copilot. So, Copilot, Copilot agents built-in Copilot Studio, autonomous agents built in Copilot Studio, that's the full system we think that comes together, and we feel very, very good about the position. And then, of course, we are taking the underlying system services across that entire stack that I just talked about, making it available in Azure, right? So, you have the raw infrastructure if you want it. You have the model layer independent of it. You have the AI app server in Azure AI, right? So, everything is also a building block service in Azure for you to be able to build. In fact, if you want to build everything that we have built in the Copilot stack, you can build it yourself using the AI platform. So that's sort of, in simple terms, our strategy, and that's kind of how it all comes together.
Brett Iversen: Operator, we have time for one last question.
Operator: And the last question will come from the line of Rishi Jaluria with RBC. Please proceed.
Rishi Jaluria: I want to go and think a little bit about Copilot. How we should be thinking about kind of numbers here with the recategorization? It seems like that was maybe softer in the past than expected or maybe with the numbers this quarter starting to pick up. Can you maybe walk us through what you're seeing on that? And maybe more importantly, how we should be thinking about your overall AI strategy on consumer versus enterprise, especially now with the stock on the fold?
Satya Nadella: Yes. On the first part, Rishi, to your question, I think we feel very, very good about the momentum we have in the commercial Copilot, right? As I said in my remarks and Amy talked about, this is the fastest growth of a new suite in M365. If I compare it to what we saw even way back in E3 or E5 or the transition from O to M, this is really much faster, right? It's the numbers of penetration of the Fortune 500 and then the fact that they're coming back for more seats and what have you. So, it's very strong in that context. The other thing I'd like to mention is that we want this to be something that is systemic, right, because people need to be able to put the security controls, then they need to deploy, then there's skilling and then there's change management. So, this is not like you just -- it's not a tool like when I talk about Copilot, Copilot Studio, agents. It's really as much about a new way to work. And sometimes I describe it as what happened throughout the '90s with PC penetration. After all, if you take a business process like forecasting, what was it like pre e-mail and Excel and post e-mail and Excel, that's the type of change that you see with Copilot. But overall, we feel great about the rate of progress and the penetration. And then on the consumer side, look, for us, the exciting part here is to be able to use the same investment we are making in the commercial where we have structural strength and then beyond the offense. One of the things that I think I hope you all catch in our earnings is ex-TAC, our revenue, when it comes to what we describe as search, news and ads, is growing faster than market. So, it's fantastic to see that. And so that's kind of our consumer business, which in Microsoft's large scope, it's sort of even a $10-plus billion business or sometimes go missing. But in our case, it is actually a fantastic growth business that's growing faster than market. We feel good about how we will use AI in LinkedIn. In fact, LinkedIn is a consumer business as you know. You saw even this week, they announced some new capabilities for both consumers and, in their case, even recruiting. So, we think that AI, the same investment gets monetized even through LinkedIn's innovation. And gaming, of course, is another place where you'll see some of these things apply. And Windows, right? So, the place where I think I'm excited about is Copilot+ PCs. For us, it's not about having a disconnected edge. It's about having hybrid AI where the rebirth of sort of the PC as the edge of AI is going to be one of the most exciting things for developers. So, we feel well positioned, quite frankly, with the same investment. So, this is -- that's the thing. We're not a conglomerate here. We are sort of one company. That means we invest once and then we have all these categories that benefit from that, and that's the theory of the firm for us. And so, we feel good about all of that coming together.
Amy Hood: And maybe just to add one piece because I think Rishi, now that I'm listening and thinking through the question, it feels like you're wondering like, why am I not seeing the Copilot, if you've made all this progress and the results, and the answer is you already are. In that M365 commercial number, we've seen that seat growth but those seats that we're adding, the majority of them are driven by frontline worker and small businesses. Those have a lower ARPU point. And so, it masks some of the ARPU that we're already seeing not just from E5, which continues to contribute, but also this quarter, additional impact from Copilot. So, as we go forward, being able -- that is where you're going to see the impact will be in ARPU and M365 commercial, as Satya said, I think you'll see the impact of Copilot engagement, frankly, across the same ex-TAC number.
Brett Iversen: Thanks, Rishi. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you again soon.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.",2024-10-30
MSFT,2025,2,2025-Q2-MSFT,"Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Microsoft Fiscal Year 2025 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Brett Iversen, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Brett Iversen: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Alice Jolla, Chief Accounting Officer; and Keith Dolliver, Corporate Secretary and Deputy General Counsel. On the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provides the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. More detailed outlook slides will be available on the Microsoft Investor Relations website when we provide outlook commentary on today's call. On this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP items. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's second quarter performance in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results. All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are the same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rate only. We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript, and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website. During this call, we'll be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.
Satya Nadella: Thank you, Brett. This quarter we saw continued strength in Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $40 billion in revenue for the first time, up 21% year-over-year. Enterprises are beginning to move from proof-of-concepts to enterprise-wide deployments to unlock the full ROI of AI. And our AI business has now surpassed an annual revenue run rate of $13 billion up 175% year-over-year. Before I get into the details of the quarter, I want to comment on the core thesis behind our approach to how we manage our fleet and how we allocate our capital to compute. AI scaling laws are continuing to compound across both pre-training and inference time compute. We ourselves have been seeing significant efficiency gains in both training and inference for years now. On inference, we have typically seen more than 2x price performance gain for every hardware generation and more than 10x for every model generation due to software optimizations. And as AI becomes more efficient and accessible, we will see exponentially more demand. Therefore, much as we have done with the Commercial Cloud, we are focused on continuously scaling our fleet globally and maintaining the right balance across training and inference as well as geo distribution. From now on it's a more continuous cycle governed by both revenue growth and capability growth, thanks to the compounding effects of software driven AI scaling laws and Moore's Law. With that, I will walk through the progress we are making across every layer of the tech stack. Azure is the infrastructure layer for AI. We continue to expand our data center capacity in line with both near-term and long-term demand signals. We have more than doubled our overall data center capacity in the last three years and we have added more capacity last year than any other year in our history. Our data centers, networks, racks and silicon are all coming together as a complete system to drive new efficiencies to power both the cloud workloads of today and the next generation AI workloads. We continue to take advantage of Moore's Law and refresh our fleet as evidenced by our support of the latest from AMD, Intel, NVIDIA as well as our first-party silicon innovation from Maia, Cobalt, Boost and HSM. When it comes to cloud migrations, we continue to see customers like UBS move workloads to Azure. UBS alone migrated mainframe workloads encompassing nearly 400 billion records and 2 petabytes of data. And we remain the cloud of choice for customers' mission-critical Oracle, SAP and VMware apps. At the data layer, we are seeing Microsoft Fabric breakout. We now have over 19,000 paid customers from Hitachi to Johnson Controls to Schaeffler. Fabric is now the fastest growing analytics product in our history. Power BI is also deeply integrated with Fabric with over 30 million monthly active users, up 40% since last year. Beyond Fabric, we are seeing new AI-driven data patterns emerge. If you look underneath ChatGPT or Copilot or Enterprise AI apps, you see the growth of raw storage, database services and app platform services as these workloads scale. The number of Azure OpenAI apps running on Azure databases and Azure app services more than doubled year-over-year driving significant growth and adoption across SQL Hyperscale and Cosmos DB. Now on to AI platform and tools, as we shared last week we are thrilled OpenAI has made a new large Azure commitment. Through our strategic partnership we continue to benefit mutually from each other's growth and with OpenAI's APIs exclusively running on Azure customers can count on us to get access to the world's leading models and OpenAI has a lot more coming soon, so stay tuned. Azure AI Foundry features best-in-class tooling, run times to build agents, multi-agent apps, AI ops, API access to thousands of models. Two months in, we already have more than 200,000 monthly active users and we are well positioned with our support of both OpenAI's leading models and the best selection of Open Source models and SLMs. DeepSeek's R1 launched today via the model catalog on Foundry and GitHub with automated red teaming, content safety integration and security scanning. Our Phi family of SLMs has now been downloaded over 20 million times and we also have more than 30 models from partners like Bayer, Paige.AI, Rockwell Automation, Siemens to address industry specific use cases. With AI, how we build, deploy and maintain code is fundamentally changing. And GitHub Copilot is increasingly the tool of choice for both digital natives like ASOS and Spotify as well as world's largest enterprises like HP, HSBC and KPMG. We've been delighted by the early response to GitHub Copilot and VS Code with more than a million sign ups in just the first week post launch. All up GitHub now is home to 150 million developers up 50% over the past two years. Now on to the future of work. Microsoft 365 Copilot is the UI for AI. It helps supercharge employee productivity and provides access to a swarm of intelligent agents to streamline employee workflow. We are seeing accelerated customer adoption across all deal sizes as we win new Microsoft 365 Copilot customers and see the majority of existing enterprise customers come back to purchase more seats. When you look at customers who purchased Copilot during the first quarter of availability, they have expanded their seats collectively by more than 10x over the past 18 months. To share just one example, Novartis has added thousands of seats each quarter over the past year and now have 40,000 seats. Barclays, Carrier Group, Pearson and University of Miami all purchased 10,000 or more seats this quarter. And overall the number of people who use Copilot daily again more than doubled quarter-over-quarter. Employees are also engaging with Copilot more than ever. Usage intensity increased more than 60% quarter-over-quarter and we are expanding our TAM with Copilot Chat which was announced earlier this month. Copilot Chat along with Copilot Studio is now available to every employee to start using agents right in the flow of work. With Copilot Studio, we are making it as simple to build an agent as it is to create an Excel spreadsheet. More than 160,000 organizations have already used Copilot Studio and they collectively created more than 400,000 custom agents in the last three months alone up over 2x quarter-over-quarter. We've also introduced our own first-party agents to facilitate meetings, manage projects, resolve common HR and IT queries and access SharePoint data. And we also continue to see partners like Adobe, SAP, ServiceNow and Workday build their third-party agents and integrate with Copilot. What is driving Copilot as the UI for AI as well as our momentum with agents is our rich data cloud which is the world's largest source of organizational knowledge. Billions of emails, documents and chats, hundreds of millions of teams meetings and millions of SharePoint sites are added each day. This is the Enterprise Knowledge Cloud. It is growing fast up over 25% year-over-year. More broadly what we are seeing is Copilot plus agents disrupting business applications and we are leaning into this. With Dynamics 365, we took share as organizations like Ecolab, Lenovo, RTX, Total Energies, and Vizient switched to our AI powered apps from legacy providers. In Healthcare, DAX Copilot surpassed 2 million monthly physician patient encounters up 54% quarter-over-quarter. It is being used by top providers like Mass General Brigham, Michigan Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center to increase productivity of their physicians. When it comes to Windows, we are seeing momentum build as we approach end of support for Windows 10. Customers are choosing the latest Windows 11 devices for their enhanced security and advanced AI capabilities. 15% of premium priced laptops in the US this holiday were Copilot+ PCs and we expect the majority of the PCs sold in the next several years to be Copilot+ PCs. We also see more and more developments from Adobe and CapCut to WhatsApp build apps that leverage built-in NPUs. And they will soon be able to run DeepSeek's R1 distilled models locally on Copilot+ PCs as well as the vast ecosystem of GPUs available on Windows. And beyond Copilot+ PCs the most powerful AI workstation for local development is a Windows PC running WSL 2 powered by NVIDIA RTX GPUs. Now on to Security. We continue to make progress with our Secure Future initiative and we are applying what we have learned introducing over 80 new product capabilities over the past year. With Security Copilot organizations across private and public sector like City of Johannesburg, Eastman, Intesa, National Australia Bank, NTT can resolve incidents 30% faster. Data governance is increasingly critical and customers now use Microsoft Purview to audit over 2 billion Copilot interactions for safe and compliant use. Now on to our consumer businesses starting with LinkedIn. More professionals than ever are engaging in high value conversations on LinkedIn with comments up 37% year-over-year. Short form video continues to grow on the platform with video creation all up growing at twice the rate of other post formats. We're also innovating with agents to help recruiters and small businesses find qualified candidates faster and our hiring business again took share. In subscriptions, LinkedIn premiums surpassed $2 billion in annual revenue for the first time this quarter. Subscriber growth has increased nearly 50% over the past two years and nearly 40% of subscribers have used our AI features to improve their profiles. And LinkedIn marketing solution remains the leader in B2B advertising. Now on to Search Advertising and News. We once again took share across Bing and Edge. Edge surpassed 30% market share in the US on Windows and has taken share for 15 consecutive quarters. The investments we have made in improving our ad rates are paying off and advertisers increasingly see our network as an essential platform to optimize ROI. And our Copilot consumer app is seeing increased engagement and retention with its improved speed, unique personality, first of its kind features like Copilot Vision. Just today we made Think Deeper powered by o1, free for all Copilot users globally. Now on to gaming, we are focused on improving the profitability of the business in order to position it for long-term growth driven by higher margin content and platform services and we are delivering on this plan. Black Ops 6 was top selling game on Xbox and PlayStation this quarter and saw more players in its launch quarter than any other paid release in the franchise history. And we saw rave reviews of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle which has already been played by more than 4 million people. We also continue to see strong momentum for Xbox Cloud Gaming with a record 140 million hours streamed this quarter. All-up Game Pass set a new quarterly record for revenue and grew its PC subscriber base by over 30% as we focus on driving fully paid subscribers across endpoints. In closing, we continue to innovate across our tech stack to help our customers in this AI era and I'm energized by the many opportunities ahead. With that, let me turn it over to Amy.
Amy Hood: Thank you, Satya and good afternoon everyone. This quarter revenue was $69.6 billion up 12%. Gross margin dollars increased 13% and 12% in constant currency, while operating income increased 17% and 16% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $3.23 an increase of 10%. We delivered another quarter of double-digit top and bottom line growth. Results were driven by strong demand for our cloud and AI offerings, while we also improved our operating leverage with higher than expected operating income growth. As you heard from Satya, our AI business annual revenue run rate surpassed $13 billion and was above expectations. Commercial bookings increased 67% and 75% in constant currency and were significantly ahead of expectations driven by Azure commitments from OpenAI. Execution was strong across our core annuity sales motions with growth in the number of $100 million plus contracts for both Azure and Microsoft 365. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased to $298 billion, up 34% and 36% in constant currency. Roughly 40% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 21% year-over-year. The remaining portion recognized beyond the next 12 months increased 45%. And this quarter, our annuity mix was 97%. FX did not have a significant impact on our results and was roughly in line with expectations on total company revenue, More Personal Computing revenue, total company COGS, and operating expense. FX decreased revenue more than expected in our commercial segments. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $40.9 billion and grew 21%. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage was 70%, in line with expectations and decreased two points year-over-year driven by scaling our AI infrastructure. Company gross margin percentage increased slightly year-over-year to 69% primarily driven by sales mix shift to higher margin businesses as well as improvement in Gaming and Search, partially offset by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 5%, lower than expected, and operating margins increased two points year-over-year to 45%. The better than expected margin expansion was driven by delivering efficiencies across our businesses as we invest to scale AI infrastructure and build AI applications. At a total company level, headcount at the end of December was 2% higher than a year ago and was relatively unchanged from last quarter. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $29.4 billion and grew 14% and 13% in constant currency even with the unfavorable FX impact noted earlier. Results were ahead of expectations driven by Microsoft 365 Commercial. Microsoft 365 Commercial Cloud revenue increased 16% and 15% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations due to better than expected performance in E5 and Microsoft 365 Copilot. With M365 Copilot, we continue to see growth in adoption, expansion, and usage. ARPU growth was again driven by E5 and M365 Copilot. Paid M365 Commercial seats grew 7% year-over-year with installed base expansion across all customer segments, though primarily in our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings. M365 commercial products revenue increased 13%, significantly ahead of expectations driven by higher than expected transactional purchasing with the launch of Office 2024 as well as the Windows Commercial on-premises components from the better than expected performance of M365 suites noted earlier. M365 Consumer Cloud revenue increased 8%, slightly ahead of expectations. We saw continued momentum in M365 consumer subscriptions which grew 10% to 86.3 million with mix shift to M365 Basic. LinkedIn revenue increased 9% with continued growth across all lines of business. In our Talent Solutions business, results were slightly below expectations driven by continued weakness in the hiring market in key verticals. Dynamics 365 revenue increased 19% and 18% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations with growth across all workloads. Segment gross margin dollars increased 13% and 12% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year driven by scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 6% and operating income increased 16% and 15% in constant currency. Next the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $25.5 billion and grew 19% with more unfavorable FX impact than expected. Excluding the unfavorable FX impact, results in Azure non-AI services, on-prem server, and enterprise and partner services were slightly lower than expected, partially offset by better than expected results in Azure AI services. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 31%. Azure growth included 13 points from AI services, which grew 157% year-over-year and was ahead of expectations even as demand continued to be higher than our available capacity. Growth in our non-AI services was slightly lower than expected due to go-to-market execution challenges, particularly with our customers that we primarily reach through our scale motions, as we balance driving near-term non-AI consumption with AI growth. In our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 3%, slightly below expectations driven by slower than expected purchasing around Windows Server 2025 launch. Enterprise and Partner Services revenue decreased 1%, below expectations with lower than expected performance across Enterprise Support Services and Industry Solutions. Segment gross margin dollars increased 12% and 13% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased four points year-over-year driven by scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 10% and operating income grew 14%. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $14.7 billion, relatively unchanged year-over-year with better than expected results driven primarily by Windows OEM pre-builds, usage from a third-party partnership in Search, as well as Call of Duty launch performance in Gaming. Windows OEM and Devices revenue increased 4% year-over-year, ahead of expectations, driven by commercial inventory builds in advance of Windows 10 end of support as well as uncertainty around tariffs. Search and News advertising revenue ex-TAC increased 21% and 20% in constant currency, ahead of expectations driven by usage from a third-party partnership. Growth continues to be driven by rate expansion and healthy volume growth in both Edge and Bing. And in Gaming, revenue decreased 7% and 8% in constant currency as content and services growth continued to be offset by hardware declines. Xbox content and services revenue increased 2%, ahead of expectations driven by stronger than expected performance in Blizzard and Activision content, including Call of Duty. Segment gross margin dollars increased 13% and 12% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage increased six points year-over-year driven by sales mix shift to higher margin businesses as well as strong execution on margin improvement in Gaming and Search. Operating expenses decreased 1%. Operating income increased 32% and 30% in constant currency driven by continued prioritization of higher margin opportunities. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures including finance leases were $22.6 billion, in line with expectations, and cash paid for PP&E was $15.8 billion. More than half of our cloud and AI related spend was on long-lived assets that will support monetization over the next 15 years and beyond. The remaining cloud and AI spend was primarily for servers, both CPUs and GPUs, to serve customers based on demand signals including our customer contracted backlog. Cash flow from operations was $22.3 billion, up 18% driven by strong cloud billings and collections, partially offset by higher supplier, employee and tax payments. Free cash flow was $6.5 billion, down 29% year-over-year, reflecting the capital expenditures noted earlier. This quarter, other income and expense was negative $2.3 billion, lower than our October guidance due to the impairment charge from our Cruise investment. Our effective tax rate came in slightly lower than anticipated at 18%. And finally, we returned $9.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Now, moving to our Q3 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a US dollar basis. First, FX. With the strengthening of the US dollar since October, we now expect FX to decrease total revenue growth by two points. Within the segments, we expect FX to decrease revenue growth by two points in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud and roughly one point in More Personal Computing. When compared to our October guidance assumptions on Q3 FX impact, this is a decrease to total revenue of roughly $1 billion. We expect FX to decrease COGS growth by approximately two points and operating expense growth by approximately one point. Our outlook has many of the trends we saw in Q2 continue through Q3. Demand for our differentiated cloud and AI offerings across the Microsoft Cloud should drive another quarter of strong growth. In Commercial Bookings, with a relatively flat expiry base and a strong prior year comparable in terms of large Azure contracts, we expect growth to be roughly flat year-over-year. We expect consistent execution across our core annuity sales motions and continued long-term commitments to our platform. As a reminder, larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, can drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly 69%, down year-over-year driven by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure. Next to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes we expect revenue to grow between 11% and 12% in constant currency or $29.4 billion to $29.7 billion. Microsoft 365 Commercial Cloud revenue growth should be between 14% and 15% in constant currency, relatively stable compared to our better than expected Q2 results. We expect continued ARPU growth through E5 and M365 Copilot and we again expect some seat growth moderation given the size of the installed base. For M365 Commercial products, we expect revenue to be relatively unchanged year-over-year. As a reminder, M365 Commercial products include Windows Commercial on-premises components of M365 suites, so our quarterly revenue growth can have variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. M365 Consumer Cloud revenue growth should be in the mid to high-single-digits driven by M365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single-digits. Although we expect growth across all businesses, the Q2 trends in Talent Solutions should continue in Q3 as a headwind to growth. And in Dynamics 365, we expect revenue growth to be in the mid-teens driven by continued growth across all workloads. For Intelligent Cloud we expect revenue to grow between 19% and 20% in constant currency or $25.9 billion to $26.2 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q3 revenue growth to be between 31% and 32% in constant currency driven by strong demand for our portfolio of services. As we shared in October, the contribution from our AI services will grow from increased AI capacity coming online. In non-AI services healthy growth continues, although we expect ongoing impact through H2 as we work to address the execution challenges noted earlier. And while we expect to be AI capacity constrained in Q3, by the end of FY25 we should be roughly in line with near-term demand given our significant capital investments. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline in the mid-single-digits driven by a decrease in transactional purchasing. And in Enterprise and Partner services, we expect revenue growth to be in the low to mid-single-digits. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to be $12.4 billion to $12.8 billion with continued prioritization of higher margin opportunities. Windows OEM and Devices revenue should decline in the low to mid-single-digits. We expect revenue from Windows OEM to be relatively flat year-over-year as our outlook assumes inventory levels will normalize. Actual results may differ based on current tariff uncertainties. Devices revenue will decline. Search and News advertising ex-TAC revenue growth should be in the mid-teens from continued growth in both volume and revenue per search with share gains across Edge and Bing. Growth is expected to moderate from last quarter primarily due to additional FX impact and as the third-party partnership usage noted earlier returns to more normal levels. Search ex-TAC growth will be higher than overall Search and News advertising revenue growth, which we expect to be in the mid to high-single-digits. And in Gaming, we expect revenue growth to be in the low-single-digits. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth to be in the low to mid-single-digits driven by first-party content as well as Xbox Game Pass. Hardware revenue will decline year-over-year. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS to grow between 19% and 20% in constant currency or to be between $21.65 billion to $21.85 billion and operating expense to grow between 5% and 6% in constant currency or to be between $16.4 billion and $16.5 billion. Other income and expense is expected to be roughly negative $1 billion primarily driven by investments accounted for under the equity method. As a reminder, we do not recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on equity method investments. And lastly, we expect our Q3 effective tax rate to be approximately 18%. Now some additional thoughts on the rest of the fiscal year and beyond. First, FX. With the strengthening of the US dollar since October, we now expect FX to decrease Q4 revenue and COGS growth by more than one point and operating expense growth by roughly one point. Next, capital expenditures. We expect quarterly spend in Q3 and Q4 to remain at similar levels as our Q2 spend. In FY26, we expect to continue investing against strong demand signals including customer contracted backlog we need to deliver against across the entirety of our Microsoft Cloud. However, the growth rate will be lower than FY25 and the mix of spend will begin to shift back to short-lived assets which are more correlated to revenue growth. As a reminder, our long-lived infrastructure investments are fungible, enabling us to remain agile as we meet customer demand globally across our Microsoft Cloud including AI workloads. As always, there can be quarterly spend variability from cloud infrastructure build-outs and the timing of delivery of finance leases. For the full fiscal year, we continue to expect double-digit revenue and operating income growth as we focus on delivering efficiencies across both COGS and operating expense. And given the operating leverage that we've delivered throughout the year, inclusive of efficiency gains as we scale our AI infrastructure and utilize our own AI solutions, we now expect FY25 operating margins to be up slightly year-over-year. And finally, our FY25 full year effective tax rate should be between 18% and 19%. In closing, we are committed to delivering real world AI solutions that help customers grow and improve their results. We are confident in our leadership position as we grow with our customers. Before turning to Q&A, I have one special thank you. Brett Iversen is moving to a new role here as the Head of our Americas sales finance team. On behalf of the company, thank you for your tremendous impact leading Investor Relations for the past four years and for the partnership with both Satya and me. And I'd like to welcome Jonathan Neilson, the former Head of Finance for our Security products, who is returning to Investor Relations to lead the team. With that, let's go to Q&A, Brett.
Brett Iversen: Thanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Keith Weiss: Hi. Thank you guys for taking the question. And echoing Amy's comments, Brett, congratulations on the new role. It's been a pleasure working with you and best of luck in that new role. Looking at the quarter, another really solid quarter when it comes to commercial bookings. But again, we were a little disappointed on Azure coming in at the bottom end of the guidance range. Amy, I was hoping you could dig into perhaps what some of those execution issues were, what the resolution to those issues were. And do we still feel comfortable in the acceleration into the back half of the year that you were talking about after the June quarter and after last quarter? Thank you very much.
Amy Hood: Thanks, Keith. Let me spend a little time on that about what we saw in Q2 and give you some additional background on the near-term execution issues that we're talking about. First, let me be very specific. They are in the non-AI ACR component. Our Azure AI results were better than we thought due to very good work by the operating teams pulling in some delivery dates even by weeks. When your capacity constrained weeks matter, and it was good execution by the team, and you see that in the revenue results. On the non-AI side, really, the challenges were in what we call the scale motion. So think about primarily these are customers we reach through partners and through more indirect methods of selling. And really, the art form there is as these customers, which we reach in this way, are trying to balance how do you do an AI workload with continuing some of the work they've done on migrations and other fundamentals, we then took our sales motions in the summer and really change to try to balance those two. As you do that, you learn with your customers and with your partners on sort of getting that balance right between where to put our investments, where to put the marketing dollars and importantly, where to put people in terms of coverage and being able to help customers make those transitions. And I think we are going to make some adjustments to make sure we are in balance because when you make those changes in the summer, by the time it works its way through the system, you can see the impacts on whether you have that balance right. And so the teams are working through that. They're already making adjustments. And I expect, while, we will see some impact through H2 just because when you work through the scale motion, it can take some time for that to adjust. I feel good that the teams understand and are working through that. So hopefully that's just helpful on that. Then we talked a little bit about Q3. And so we've talked about 31% to 32% after publishing a 31% this quarter. Our AI results that we had felt good about and talked about our ability to land that revenue is the same. So again, in Q3, we are working from a pretty constrained capacity place. And that's no different than it was our expectation to be in that position last October when I talked to you all. And when I talk about being at a capacity constraint, it takes two things. You have to have space, which I generally call long-lived assets, right, that's the infrastructure and the land and then you have to have kits. We're continuing and you've seen that's why our spend has pivoted this way to be in the long-lived investment. We have been short, power and space. And so as you see those investments land that we've made over the past three years, we get closer to that balance by the end of this year. And so the confidence on the AI side continues to be there in terms of being able to sell, utilize and be, I think, encouraged by the signals. What we're seeing is waiting to see just how the non-AI ACR works through the scale motions in H2. But in general, the only thing that's changed is really that scale motion from my seat, Keith. Hope that's helpful. Satya?
Satya Nadella: Yes. I think, Amy, just one thing I'd add, Keith, to your question is, as Amy said, the AI growth rate is actually better than what we expected, and we work through some of the supply stuff and more importantly, some of the workloads are scaling well. And when you look underneath any of these AI workloads, the other thing that is good is the ratio even what we would call just regular storage, data services, app services. So underneath a ChatGPT or a Copilot or even the emerging AI workloads in the enterprise. So that's all good. The enterprise workloads, whether it's SAP or whether it's VMware migrations, what have you, that's also in good shape. And it's just the scale place where Amy talked about this nuance, right, how do you really tweak the incentives, go-to-market at a time of platform shifts, you kind of want to make sure you lean into even the new design wins, and you just don't keep doing the stuff that you did in the previous generation. And that's the art form Amy was referencing to make sure you get the right balance. But let me put it this way. You would rather win the new than just protect the past. And that's sort of another thing that we definitely will lean into always.
Keith Weiss: Excellent.
Brett Iversen: Thanks, Keith. Operator, next question please.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.
Mark Moerdler: Thank you very much for taking my question. Can you give more color on what drove the far larger than expected Microsoft AI revenue. We talked a bit about the Azure AI component of it. But can you give more color on that? And our estimates are that the Copilot was much bigger than we had expected and growing much faster. Any more details on the breakdown of what that Microsoft AI would be great? Thanks.
Amy Hood: Thanks, Mark, for the question. Yes, that was, as we talked about better than expected. A couple of pieces to that, which you've correctly identified. Number one is the Azure component we just talked about. And the second piece, you're right, Microsoft Copilot was better. And what was important about that it was -- we saw strength both in seats, both new seats and expansion seats, as Satya talked about, and usage, which doesn't directly impact revenue, but of course, indirectly does as people get more and more value on it. And also price per seat was actually quite good. We still have a good signal for value. So those are the biggest pieces, Mark, of that sort of outperformance in terms of our expectations.
Mark Moerdler: Thank you.
Brett Iversen: Thanks, Mark. Operator, next question please.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed.
Brent Thill: Thanks. Satya, you mentioned DeepSeek a couple of times in your prepared remarks. I think everyone would love your thoughts on what you're seeing there. And are we seeing AI scale now at lower cost? Are we reaching a mark where you can see that or do we still have some time to go? Thanks for your thoughts on this.
Satya Nadella: Yes. Thanks, Brent. So, yes, in my remarks, I talked about how in some sense, what's happening with AI is no different than what was happening with the regular compute cycle. It's always about bending the curve and then putting more points up the curve. So there's Moore's Law that's working in hyperdrive. Then on top of that, there is the AI scaling laws, both the pre-training and the inference time compute that compound and that's all software. You should think of what I said in my remarks, which we have observed for a while, which is 10x on improvements per cycle just because of all the software optimizations on inference. And so that's what you see. And then to that, I think DeepSeek has had some real innovations. And that is some of the things that even OpenAI found in o1. And so we are going to, obviously, now that all gets commoditized, and it's going to get broadly used. And the big beneficiaries of any software cycle like that is the customers, right. Because at the end of the day, if you think about it, right, what was the big lesson learned from client server to cloud, more people bought servers except it was called cloud. And so when token prices fall, infants computing prices fall, that means people can consume more, and there'll be more apps written. And it's interesting to see that when I referenced these models that are pretty powerful, it's unimaginable to think that here we are in sort of beginning of '25 where on the PC, you can run a model that required pretty massive cloud infrastructure. So that type of optimizations means AI will be much more ubiquitous. And so therefore, for a hyperscaler like us, a PC platform provider like us, this is all good news as far as I'm concerned.
Brent Thill: Thank you.
Brett Iversen: Thanks, Brent. Operator, next question please.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed.
Karl Keirstead: Thank you. Maybe this one as well for Satya and it's also away from the numbers. But Satya, I wanted to ask you about the Stargate news and the announced changes in the OpenAI relationship last week. It seems that most of your investors have interpreted this as Microsoft, for sure, remaining very committed to OpenAI's success. But electing to take more of a backseat in terms of funding OpenAI's future training CapEx needs. I was hoping you might frame your strategic decision here around Stargate, and Amy, whether there's any takeaway for investors from that decision in terms of how you're thinking about CapEx needs over the next several years. Thank you.
Satya Nadella: Yes. Thanks for the question. So we remain very happy with the partnership with OpenAI. And as you saw, they have committed in a big way to Azure and even in the bookings what we recognize is just the first tranche of it. And so you'll see given the ROFR we have more benefits of that even into the future. And obviously, their success is our success because even all the other commercial arrangements that we detailed out in the blog that we put out even commensurate with that announcement. But to your overall point, the thing that I would say is we are building a pretty fungible fleet, right. We're making sure that there's the right balance between training and inference. It's geo distributed. We are working super hard on all the software oppositions, right. I mean just not the software optimizations that come because of what DeepSeek has done, but all the work we have done to, for example, reduce the prices of GPT models, over the years in partnership with OpenAI. In fact, we did a lot of the work on the inference optimizations on it and that's been key to driving, right. One of the key things to note in AI is you just don't launch the frontier model, but if it's too expensive to serve, it's no good, right. It won't generate any demand. So you've got to have that optimization, so that inferencing costs are coming down and they can be consumed broadly. And so that's the fleet physics we are managing. And also, remember, you don't want to buy too much of anything at one time because the Moore's Law every year is going to give you 2x, your optimization is going to give you 10x. You want to continuously upgrade the fleet, modernize the fleet, age, the fleet, and at the end of the day, have the right ratio of monetization and demand-driven monetization to what you think of as the training expense. So I feel very good about the investment we are making and it's fungible and it just allows us to scale more long-term business.
Amy Hood: And maybe, Karl, just to reiterate a little of the comments that I made on CapEx because I think it's helpful to surround a bit more in what Satya is saying, a fungible fleet means. We have and I think we talked about it, close to $300 billion of RPO, that is committed customer contracts that need to be delivered on. And the faster we can do that and the more efficiently we can do that, the better off we are not just the OpenAI partnership, which is a piece of that, but with the entire platform that we need to deliver for our customers. And I think the other thing that's sometimes missing is when we say fungible, we mean not just the primary use, which we've always talked about, which is inference, but there is some training, post training, which is a key component. And then they're just running the commercial hub, which at every layer under at every modern AI app that's going to be built, it will be required. It will be required to be distributed, and it will be required to be global. And all of those things are really important because it then means you're the most efficient. And so the investment you see us making CapEx. You're right, the front end has been this sort of infrastructure build that lets us really catch up not just on the AI infrastructure we needed, but think about that as the building itself, data centers, but also some of the catch-up we need to do on the commercial cloud side. And then you'll see the pivot to more CPU and GPU. And that pivot will more directly correlate to revenue and it will be contracted either with the partnership that you asked about with OpenAI or with others. And so I do think the way I want everyone to internalize it is that the CapEx growth is going through that cycle pivot, which is far more correlated to customer contract delivery, no matter who the end customer is.
Karl Keirstead: Thank you.
Brett Iversen: Thanks, Karl. Operator, next question please.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Brad Zelnick: Thank you very much for taking my question. And I'll echo my congrats and gratitude to Brett as well. Satya, as we think about Microsoft's very rich Copilot portfolio, now having been in market for over a year, with the products and precision only getting better and the cost of inference coming down, how do you think about the journey from here and perhaps the ability to package and evolve the go-to-market to address the broadest range of customers and customer requirements out there? Thanks.
Satya Nadella: Thanks, Brad, for the question. In fact you saw us make two announcements recently. One is on the M365 Copilot side, we now have the Copilot Chat. So this is now going to be broadly deployed across the entire install base effectively because you can go have this now turned on by IT and everybody can start using web-grounded chat with all the enterprise controls right away it has Copilot Studio built in. And so that means they can start building agents. So we think of that plus the full Copilot as a good combination that I think will accelerate quite frankly in terms of just seat usage and agent building and what have you. So that's sort of one. And the other thing is you also see even on the consumer side, we just yesterday launched o1, the Think Harder feature on Copilot now that's powered by o1, it's available globally, right. So you can see the benefits of inference optimization and the cost coming down means you can drive more ubiquity of what were features that ones were sort of premium tier and that's all definitely something that we will do across, right. The same thing is happening in GitHub Copilot, same thing in Security Copilot. So across the length and breadth of our portfolio, you'll see that.
Brad Zelnick: Thank you.
Brett Iversen: Thanks, Brad. Operator, next question please.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. Please proceed.
Brad Reback: That's great. Thank you very much. Satya, if you look out several years, any sense of what percent of inference done on Azure will be done on proprietary models versus open models. And with that said, does it matter to Microsoft at the end of the day? Thanks.
Satya Nadella: Yes, it's a good question because at some level, what you're seeing is effectively lots of models that get used in any application, right. When you look underneath even a Copilot or a GitHub Copilot or what have you, you already see lots of many different models that you build models, you fine tune models, you distill models. Some of them are models that you distill into an open source model. So there's going to be a combination. So we've always maintained that it's always good to have frontier models. You want to always build your application with high ambition using the best model that is available and then optimize from there on. So that's also another side like there's a temporality to it, right. What you start with as a given COGS profile doesn't need to be the end because you continuously optimize for latency and COGS and putting in different mode. And in fact, all that complexity, by the way, has to be managed by a new app server. So one of the things that we are investing heavily on is foundry because from an app developer perspective, you kind of want to keep pace with the flurry of models that are coming in and you want to have an evergreen way for your application to benefit from all that innovation. But not have all the Dev cost or the DevOps cost or what people talk about AIOps costs. So we are also investing significantly in all the app server for any workload to be able to benefit from all these different models, open source, close source, different weight classes. And at the same time, from an operations perspective, it's faster, easier for you.
Brad Reback: Great. Thank you.
Brett Iversen: Thanks, Brad. Operator, next question please.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please proceed.
Bradley Sills: Wonderful. Thank you so much. Great to hear about the strength you're seeing in Copilot. Would love to get some color as to where you're seeing that strength? Is it departmental deals, customers moving from proof-of-concept to departmental deals, maybe multiple departmental deals in the enterprise. You mentioned some uptick in usage trends. Would love to get some color on just the common use cases that you're seeing that give you that confidence that, that will ramp into monetization later. Thank you.
Satya Nadella: Yes. I mean, I think the initial sort of set of seats were for places where there's more belief in immediate productivity, a sales team, in finance or in supply chain, where there is a lot of like, for example, SharePoint rounded data that you want to be able to use in conjunction with web data and have it produce results that are beneficial. But then what's happening, very much like what we have seen in the previous generation productivity things is that people collaborate across functions, across roads, right. For example, even in my own daily habit is, I go to chat, I use work tab, I get results, and then I immediately share using pages with colleagues. I sort of call it think with AI and work with people. And that pattern then requires you to make it more of a standard issue across the enterprise. And so that's what we are seeing. It starts maybe at a department level. Quickly, the collaboration network effects will effectively demand that you spread it across. You can do it by cohort and what have you. And so what we've made it easier even is to start with Copilot Chat plus this. And so that gives the enterprise customers even more flexibility to have something that's more ubiquitous.
Bradley Sills: Wonderful. Thank you so much.
Brett Iversen: Thanks, Brad. Operator, we have time one last question.
Operator: And the last question will come from the line of Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. Please proceed.
Brent Bracelin: Thank you for taking the question here. Good afternoon. I wanted to go back to commercial Bookings. Commercial RPO, I think, increased 39 billion sequentially. That's the most we've ever seen on a sequential basis, commercial bookings growth, 75% constant currency. That's 2x higher than we've seen in the last decade. I appreciate there's some volatility with this metric, but it does feel like this quarter there was a bit of a sea change relative to momentum on backlog and bookings. Can you just talk about maybe the breadth of where that strength came from? Was it broad-based? Was there a couple of large deals? Any color there would be helpful? Thanks.
Amy Hood: Thanks, Brent. It's a great question. We talked a little bit about what are the main drivers, which was one of the Azure commitments that OpenAI has made. And I do want to say, well, that is obviously a big component, you'll continue to see OpenAI make commitment. So I want to separate the concept that it's one time versus an ongoing relationship that will grow as they grow, which it absolutely will. And to your question on what else is participating in that number. First, we did have very good core motions. Our core motions are things like, to your point, renewals of our existing contracts, add-on to those contracts upsell like, for example, Copilot or GitHub Copilot or other processes. And I think that's important. We also had a good E5 quarter, which when we talk a lot about M365 Copilot, I sometimes forget to also talk about suite momentum. And we saw that as well this quarter, which we felt very good about. And then the final component is large Azure commitments. And those really did look as we expected, which is good. To your point, and that you're seeing a really broad-based growth. Those Azure commitments take two forms. One, it's existing customers who've worked through their commitments and are making larger commitments, which is a good commitment signed for the platform. And then you have new customers making commitments, and we also saw that this quarter. And so to your point, sometimes I think a big number that looks like this can make you think it's just one thing. I think you're right. Some of it was one thing, but a lot of it was good execution consistently across the workloads.
Brent Bracelin: Helpful color. Thank you.
Brett Iversen: Thanks, Brad. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for joining today and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon.
Satya Nadella: Thank you all.
Amy Hood: Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and enjoy the rest of your day.",2025-01-29
MSFT,2025,3,2025-Q3-MSFT,"Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Microsoft Fiscal Year 2025 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Jonathan Neilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Neilson: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer; Alice Jolla, Chief Accounting Officer; and Keith Dolliver, Corporate Secretary and Deputy General Counsel. On the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today’s call and provides the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. More detailed outlook slides will be available on the Microsoft Investor Relations website when we provide outlook commentary on today’s call. On this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP items. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's third quarter performance in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results. All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency, when available, as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are the same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rate only. We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript, and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website. During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements which are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the risk factor section of our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Satya.
Satya Nadella: Thank you, Jonathan. It was a record quarter, driven by continued strength of Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $42 billion in revenue, up 22% in constant currency. Cloud and AI are the essential inputs for every business to expand output, reduce costs, and accelerate growth. Now, I will highlight examples, starting with infrastructure. We continue to expand our data center capacity. This quarter alone, we opened DCs in 10 countries across four continents. Model capabilities are doubling in performance every six months, thanks to multiple, compounding scaling laws. We continue to optimize and drive efficiencies across every layer – from DC design, to hardware and silicon, to systems software, to model optimization – all towards lowering costs and increasing performance. You see this in our supply chain, where we have reduced dock-to-lead times for new GPUs by nearly 20%. Across our blended fleet, where we have increased AI performance by nearly 30% ISO power. And, our cost per token, which has more than halved. When it comes to cloud migrations, we saw accelerating demand, with customers in every industry, from Abercrombie & Fitch Co., to Coca-Cola and ServiceNow, expanding their footprints on Azure. And we remain the cloud of choice for customers’ mission critical VMWare, SAP, and Oracle workloads, with more regional availability than any other hyperscaler. We are also excited about the next frontier in cloud systems with quantum. In addition to putting our quantum stack on machines from our partners, we are also making real progress on a path to a utility scale quantum computer with the introduction of Majorana-1. When it comes to data and analytics, we have deeply integrated our AI platform with our data stack. PostgreSQL usage accelerated for the third consecutive quarter, and it is now used by nearly 60% of the Fortune 500 including companies like BMW and BNY Mellon. Cosmos DB revenue growth also accelerated again this quarter and remains the go-to database for globally distributed NoSQL workloads at any scale. It is used by customers in every industry like CarMax, DocuSign, NTT Data, and OpenAI. This quarter, we also saw analytics consumption accelerate. Microsoft Fabric has more than 21,000 paid customers, up 80% year-over-year. Fabric brings together data workloads like data warehousing, data science, real-time intelligence, along with Power BI, into one end-to-end solution. Real-time intelligence is now the fastest growing workload in Fabric, with 40% of customers already using it just five months since becoming generally available. All up, more than 50% of Fabric customers – like Amore Pacific, Louisiana state government, and Petrobras – use three or more workloads. And the amount of data in our multi-cloud data lake OneLake has grown more than 6X over the past year. Now, on to AI platforms and tools. Foundry is the agent and AI app factory. It is now used by developers at over 70,000 enterprises and digital natives – from Atomicwork, to Epic, Fujitsu, and Gainsight, to H&R Block and LG Electronics – to design, customize, and manage their AI apps and agents. We processed over 100 trillion tokens this quarter, up 5X year-over-year – including a record 50 trillion tokens last month alone. And four months in, over 10,000 organizations have used our new Agent Service to build, deploy, and scale their agents. This quarter we also made a new suite of fine-tuning tools available to customers with industry-leading reliability. And we brought the latest models from OpenAI, along with new models from Cohere, DeepSeek, Meta, Mistral, Stability to Foundry. And we have expanded our Phi family of SLMs with new multimodal and mini models. All up, Phi has been downloaded 38 million times. And our research teams are taking it one step further, with BitNet b1.58, a billion parameter large language model that can run on just CPUs, coming to the Foundry. Now, on to developer tools. We are evolving GitHub Copilot from pair to peer programmer. With agent mode in VS Code, Copilot can now iterate on code, recognize errors, and fix them automatically. This adds to other Copilot agents like Autofix, which helps developers remediate vulnerabilities, as well as Code Review Agent, which has already reviewed over 8 million pull requests. And we are previewing a first-of-its-kind SWE agent capable of asynchronously executing developer tasks. All-up, we now have over 15 million GitHub Copilot users, up over 4X year-over-year. And both digital natives like Twilio and enterprises like Cisco, HPE, SkyScanner, and Target, continue to choose GitHub Copilot to equip their developers with AI throughout the entire dev lifecycle. With Visual Studio and VS Code, we have the world’s most popular editor, with over 50 million monthly active users. And with Power Platform we have the leading low code platform for AI makers too. We now have 56 million monthly active Power Platform users, up 27% year-over-year, who increasingly use our AI features to build apps and automate processes. Now, on to the future of work. Microsoft 365 Copilot is built to facilitate human-agent collaboration. Hundreds of thousands of customers across geographies and industries now use Copilot, up 3X year-over-year. Our overall deal size continues to grow, and this quarter, we saw a record number of customers returning to buy more seats. And we are going further. Just last week, we announced a major update, bringing together agents, notebooks, search, and create into a new scaffolding for work. Our new Researcher and Analyst deep reasoning agents analyze vast amounts of web and enterprise data to deliver highly-skilled expertise on demand directly within Copilot. Beyond horizontal knowledge work, we are introducing agents for every role and business process. Our Sales Agent turns contacts into qualified leads, and with Sales Chat reps can quickly get up to speed on new accounts. And our Customer Service Agent is deflecting customer inquiries and helping service reps resolve issues faster. With Copilot Studio, customers can extend Copilot and build their own agents with no-code/low code. More than 230,000 organizations – including 90% of the Fortune 500 – have already used Copilot Studio. With deep reasoning and agent flows in Copilot Studio, customers can build agents that perform more complex tasks, and also handle deterministic scenarios like document processing and financial approvals. And they can now build “computer use” agents that take action on the UI across desktop and web apps. And, with just a click, they can turn any SharePoint site into an agent too. This quarter alone, customers created over 1 million custom agents across SharePoint and Copilot Studio, up 130% quarter-over-quarter. When it comes to business applications, Dynamics 365 again took share as companies like Avaya, Brunswick, SoftCat, switched to Dynamics from legacy providers. Verizon, for example, chose Dynamics 365 Sales to improve the efficiency of its sellers. In healthcare, Dragon Copilot is off to a fast start. Last quarter alone, we helped document nearly 9.5 million physician-patient encounters at providers like City of Hope, Ottawa Hospital, Tufts Medicine and WellStar, up over 50% quarter-over-quarter. In manufacturing, we introduced Factory Operations and Safety Agents at Hannover Messe. And leading partners like Autodesk, PTC, and Siemens have all built their own industrial AI solutions on our stack. And, in retail, we have introduced agents to help customers like Bath & Body Works build more personalized shopping experiences and improve store operations. When it comes to Windows, Copilot+ PCs are faster and have better battery life than other devices in their category. We also continue to win new customers with best-in-class AI capabilities. We offer a growing number of AI apps from partners like Adobe, Canva, and Zoom. Just last week, we rolled out exclusive AI experiences like Recall, Click to Do, and Windows Search, to all Copilot+ PCs. And we continue to see increased commercial traction as we approach end-of-support for Windows 10. Windows 11 commercial deployments increased nearly 75% year-over-year. Now, on to security. Security is our top priority, and we have made significant progress against the engineering objectives we outlined a year and a half ago as part of our Secure Future Initiative. We are now applying these learnings to deliver new innovation across our platform. Last month, along with our partners, we introduced Security Copilot agents to help defenders autonomously handle high-volume security and IT tasks, informed by 84 trillion daily threat signals. We also added new capabilities to Defender, Entra, and Purview to help organizations secure and govern their AI deployments. All up, we now have 1.4 million security customers. Over 900,000 – including EY Global, Manpower Group, TriNet, Regions Bank – have 4 or more workloads, up 21% year-over-year. And, in identity, Entra now has more than 900 million monthly active users. Now, on to our consumer businesses, starting with LinkedIn. Over one billion professionals use LinkedIn to connect, learn, hire, and sell – and our membership continues to grow at double digits year-over-year. Time spent watching videos on the platform was up 36%, and comments were up 32% year-over-year. We are also seeing more members use AI to gain new skills and find jobs. The number of learners who have used AI-powered coaching increased over 2X quarter-over-quarter. And we remain the market leader in hiring, as customers like Equinix and Verizon use LinkedIn Hiring Assistant to find qualified candidates faster. When it comes to LinkedIn Premium, we saw over 75% quarter-over-quarter subscriber growth to our Premium Pages offering for SMBs. And LinkedIn Marketing Solutions continues to be the best way to reach B2B decision makers, with two consecutive quarters of accelerated revenue growth. More broadly, when it comes to advertising, we are transforming how people search, browse, discover content, and use AI as a personal assistant. With Copilot Search in Bing, we are reimagining search results with overview pages curated by AI, and embedded conversational capabilities. With Copilot Vision in Edge, Copilot sees what you see and gives you real-time responses while you browse. With Copilot Discover, we are personalizing the MSN experience, based on user interactions and preferences. And with our updated Copilot app, we are focused on building daily engagement and successful sessions across a range of modalities, whether it is conversing, searching, shopping, or travel planning. All up, we again took share across Bing and Edge. And our total advertising revenue across our businesses has surpassed $20 billion over the last 12 months. Now, on to gaming. We continue to transform the business and focus on margin expansion, as we bring our games to over 500 million monthly active users across devices. We ended the quarter as the top publisher by pre-orders and pre-installs on both Xbox and the PlayStation Store. PC Game Pass revenue increased over 45% year-over-year. With Xbox Play Anywhere, players now can access more than 1,000 games they can play across console and PC. And just last week we brought cloud gaming to LG TVs. Cloud gaming set a new record, surpassing 150 million hours played for the first time this quarter. We are also integrating AI across Xbox. New Copilot for Gaming is a personalized gaming companion that provides in-game assistance and expert coaching. And our first of its kind Muse model can generate gameplay in real-time. Finally, it is fantastic to see the success of Minecraft Movie which is the top grossing film of the year. In addition to monetizing our IP in new ways, we have seen a 75 percent-plus increase in weekly active users of the game year-over-year since the release. In closing, we are rapidly innovating to expand our opportunity across both consumer and commercial businesses. In just a few weeks, at our Build conference, we will share how we’re creating the most powerful AI platform for developers—and I encourage you to tune in. With that, let me turn it over to Amy.
Amy Hood: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone. This quarter, revenue was $70.1 billion, up 13% and 15% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 11% and 13% in constant currency while operating income increased 16% and 19% in constant currency. And earnings per share was $3.46, an increase of 18% and 19% in constant currency. Results exceeded expectations driven by focused execution from our sales and partner teams. We continue to see strong demand for our cloud and AI offerings as they help customers drive productivity, increase efficiencies, and grow their businesses. And, again this quarter, revenue from our AI business was above expectations. Commercial bookings increased 18% and 17% in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations again this quarter, driven by an Azure commitment from OpenAI. We also saw consistent execution across our core annuity sales motions and continued long-term commitments to our platform. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased to $315 billion, up 34% and 33% in constant currency. Roughly 40% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 17% year over year. The remaining portion, recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 47%. And this quarter, our annuity mix was 98%. FX was roughly in line with expectations on total company revenue, segment level revenue, and operating expense growth. FX decreased COGS growth by only 1 point, 1 point unfavorable to expectations. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $42.4 billion, ahead of expectations, and grew 20% and 22% in constant currency. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage was 69%, in line with expectations, and decreased 3 points year over year driven by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure. Company gross margin percentage was also 69%, down 1 point year over year driven by scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 2% and 3% in constant currency, lower than expected due to our focus on cost efficiencies as well as investments that shifted to Q4. Operating margins increased 1 point year over year to 46%, better than expected as we continue to focus on building high-performing teams and increasing our agility by reducing layers with fewer managers. At a total company level, headcount at the end of March was 2% higher than a year ago and was down slightly compared to last quarter. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $29.9 billion and grew 10% and 13% in constant currency, ahead of expectations driven by LinkedIn, Microsoft 365 commercial products, and Microsoft 365 consumer. M365 commercial cloud revenue increased 12% and 15% in constant currency, in line with expectations. ARPU growth was again driven by E5 and M365 Copilot. With M365 Copilot, we continue to see growth across customer segments and geos. Paid M365 commercial seats grew 7% year over year to over 430 million. While we continue to see installed base expansion across all customer segments, growth was primarily driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings. M365 commercial products revenue increased 5% and 8% in constant currency, ahead of expectations due to higher-than-expected Office transactional purchasing. M365 consumer cloud revenue increased 10% and 12% in constant currency, ahead of expectations driven by higher-than-expected subscription growth following the January price increase. M365 consumer subscriptions grew 9% to 87.7 million. LinkedIn revenue increased 7% and 8% in constant currency. Results were ahead of expectations due to better-than-expected performance across all businesses. The Talent Solutions business continues to be impacted by weakness in the hiring market. Dynamics 365 revenue increased 16% and 18% in constant currency, in line with expectations with continued growth across all workloads. Segment gross margin dollars increased 10% and 13% in constant currency and gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged year over year even with the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 1% and 2% in constant currency and operating income increased 15% and 18% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $26.8 billion and grew 21% and 22% in constant currency, ahead of expectations driven by Azure. In Azure and other cloud services, revenue grew 33% and 35% in constant currency including 16 points from AI services. Focused execution drove non-AI services results where we saw accelerated growth in our enterprise customer segment as well as some improvement in our scale motions. And, in Azure AI services, we brought capacity online faster than expected. In our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 6% and 4% in constant currency, slightly below expectations driven by renewals with lower in-period revenue recognition from the mix of contracts. The year over year decline is reflective of the continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Enterprise and partner services revenue increased 5% and 6% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations due to better-than-expected performance in Enterprise Support Services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 13% and 14% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased 4 points year over year driven by scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 6% and 7% in constant currency and operating income grew 17% and 18% in constant currency. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $13.4 billion and grew 6% and 7% in constant currency, ahead of expectations due to better-than-expected results across all businesses. Windows OEM and Devices revenue increased 3% year over year, ahead of expectations as tariff uncertainty through the quarter resulted in inventory levels that remained elevated. Search and news advertising revenue ex-TAC increased 21% and 23% in constant currency. Results were significantly ahead of expectations driven by usage from a third-party partnership, better-than-expected rate expansion, and volume growth across Edge and Bing. And in Gaming, revenue increased 5% and 6% in constant currency. Xbox content and services revenue increased 8% and 9% in constant currency, ahead of expectations driven by stronger-than-expected performance in third-party and first-party content. Segment gross margin dollars increased 9% and 11% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage increased 2 points year over year driven by strong execution on margin improvement in Search and Gaming. Operating expenses increased 1%. Operating income increased 21% and 23% in constant currency driven by continued prioritization of higher margin opportunities. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures including finance leases were $21.4 billion, slightly lower than expected due to normal variability from the timing of delivery of data center leases. Cash paid for PP&E was $16.7 billion. Roughly half of our cloud and AI related spend was on long-lived assets that will support monetization over the next 15 years and beyond. The remaining cloud and AI spend was primarily for servers, both CPUs and GPUs, to serve customers based on demand signals including our customer contracted backlog of $315 billion. Cash flow from operations was $37 billion, up 16% driven by strong cloud billings and collections, partially offset by higher tax payments. And this quarter, free cash flow was $20.3 billion. Other income and expense was negative $623 million, more favorable than anticipated primarily due to net gains on derivatives and investments. Our losses on investments accounted for under the equity method were slightly higher than expected. Our effective tax rate was approximately 18%. And finally, we returned $9.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, an increase of 15% year over year. Now, moving to our Q4 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a US dollar basis. First, thru April, demand signals across our commercial businesses as well as in LinkedIn, Gaming, and Search have remained consistent. Our outlook assumes those trends continue in Q4. If the environment changes, our results may be impacted. In our Windows OEM business, our outlook assumes the elevated inventory levels from Q3 will come down in Q4. We have widened our guidance range in our More Personal Computing segment to account for some of this variability. Next, FX. With the weakening of the US dollar in April, we now expect FX to increase total revenue growth by one point. Within the segments, we expect FX to increase revenue growth by one point in Productivity and Business Processes and less than one point in Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing. We expect FX to increase COGS and operating expense growth by less than one point. In commercial bookings, we expect solid growth on a significant prior year comparable and a growing expiry base. Bookings growth will be driven by strong execution across our core annuity sales motions and continued long-term commitments to our platform. As a reminder, larger longer-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, can drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly 67%, down year over year primarily driven by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure. And now, capital expenditures. We expect Q4 capital expenditures to increase on a sequential basis. H2 capex in total remains unchanged from our January H2 guidance. As a reminder, there can be quarterly spend variability from cloud infrastructure buildouts and the timing of delivery of finance leases. Next to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes we expect revenue of $32.05 to $32.35 billion, or growth of 11% to 12% in constant currency. M365 commercial cloud revenue growth should be approximately 14% in constant currency, relatively stable compared to the prior quarter. We expect continued ARPU growth thru E5 and M365 Copilot and some seat growth moderation given the size of the installed base. M365 commercial products revenue growth should be in the mid-single digits. As a reminder, M365 commercial products includes both the Windows Commercial on-premises components of M365 suites and Office transactional purchasing, both of which can be variable due to in period revenue recognition dynamics. M365 consumer cloud revenue growth should be in the mid-teens driven by the January price increase. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the high single digits. And in Dynamics 365, we expect revenue growth to be in the mid to high teens with continued growth across all workloads. For Intelligent Cloud we expect revenue of $28.75 to $29.05 billion or growth of 20% to 22% in constant currency. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q4 revenue growth to be between 34% and 35% in constant currency driven by strong demand for our portfolio of services. In our non-AI services, we expect focused execution to continue driving healthy growth. In our AI services, while we continue to bring datacenter capacity online as planned, demand is growing a bit faster. Therefore, we now expect to have some AI capacity constraints beyond June. In our on-premises server business, we again expect revenue to decline in the mid-single digits with the ongoing customer shift to cloud offerings. And in Enterprise and partner services, we expect revenue growth to be in the mid to high single digits driven by Enterprise Support Services. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to be $12.35 to $12.85 billion. Windows OEM and Devices revenue should decline in the mid to high single digits. We expect Windows OEM revenue to decline in the low to mid-single digits assuming OEM inventory levels come down thru the quarter as noted earlier, although the range of potential outcomes is wider than normal. Devices revenue should decline in the high teens. Search and news advertising ex-TAC revenue growth should be in the high teens, even on a strong prior year comparable. We expect to see continued growth in both volume and revenue per search with share gains across Edge and Bing. Overall Search and news advertising revenue growth should be in the mid-teens. And in Gaming, we expect revenue growth to be in the mid-single digits. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth to be in the high single digits driven by first-party content. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS of $23.6 to $23.8 billion or growth of 19% to 20% in constant currency and operating expense of $18 to $18.1 billion or growth of approximately 5% in constant currency. Therefore, even with ongoing AI investments as we scale, we continue to expect full-year FY25 operating margins to be up slightly year over year. Other income and expense is expected to be roughly negative $1.2 billion primarily driven by investments accounted for under the equity method. As a reminder, we do not recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on equity method investments. And lastly, we expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. Now I’d like to share some closing thoughts as we look to the next fiscal year. We remain committed to investing against the strong demand signals we see for our services. So, as a reminder, our earlier comments on FY26 capital expenditures remain unchanged. We expect capex to grow, it will grow at a lower rate than FY25 and will include a greater mix of short-lived assets which are more directly correlated to revenue than long-lived assets. These investments, along with focused execution that delivers near-term value to our customers, will ensure we continue to lead through the cloud and AI opportunity ahead. With that, let’s go to Q&A, Jonathan.
Jonathan Neilson: Thanks, Amy. We’ll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?
Operator: [Operator instructions]
Keith Weiss, Morgan Stanley: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question, and congratulations on a fantastic quarter in what all of us are looking at as a difficult environment, a lot of uncertainty out there, so really impressive to put up the results that you guys did. One of the things that we heard a lot about this quarter in the media and press reports was changing data center commitments, maybe Microsoft walking away from some of those data center commitments. But it sounds like the AI demand is very strong. You’re talking about not being able to hit all that demand with supply. Can you talk to us about what’s going on with your datacenter strategy? Are there any shifts taking place? And maybe in particular, Satya, you could talk about some of the comments that you had made about the potential risk for oversupplies and GPUs out in the future. What exactly was that risk you were talking about? And are you incorporating that risk into your datacenter strategy?
Satya Nadella: Yeah. First of all, thanks, Keith, for the questions. The reality is, we’ve always been making adjustments to build, lease, what pace we build, all through the last 10-15 years. It’s just that you all pay a lot more attention to what we do quarter over quarter nowadays. Having said that, the key thing for us is to have our builds and lease be positioned for what is the workload growth of the future. That’s what you have to go and seek to. There’s a demand part to it. There is the shape of the workload part to it, and there is a location part to it. You don’t want to be upside-down on having one big data center in one region, when you have a global demand footprint. You don’t want to be upside-down when the shape of demand changes, because, after all, with essentially pre-training plus test time compute, that’s a big change in terms of how you think about even what is training. Forget inferencing. Fundamentally, given all of that, and then every time there’s great Moore’s Law, but remember, this is a compounding S-curve, which is, there’s Moore’s Law, there’s system software, there’s model architecture changes, there’s the app server efficiency. Given all of that, we just want to make sure we’re building, accounting for the latest and greatest information we have on all of that. And that’s what you see reflected, and I feel very, very good about the pace. In fact, Amy just mentioned, we will be short power. And so, therefore, but it’s not power. It’s not a blanket statement. I need power in specific places so that we can either lease or build at the pace at which we want. And so, that’s the plan that we’re executing. Maybe, Amy, you can add to that.
Amy Hood: Yeah, maybe just to add a little bit to Satya’s comments, just a reminder, these are very long lead time decisions. From land to build to buildouts can be lead times of five to seven years, two to three years. We’re constantly in a balancing position as we watch demand curves and many of things Satya watched. And the second part is just to maybe remind you, when Satya talks about being short power, he’s really talking about data center space. And so, we’ve continued through the second half to put things in place. In fact, we talked a little bit about pulling even some of that space to be ready earlier and being able to deliver that earlier to customers this quarter, which is really good work by the teams, as we continue to get more and more efficient at that process. And I look forward to being able to continue to do that in the future. I did talk about in my comments, we had hoped to be in balance by the end of Q4. We did see some increased demand, as you saw through the quarter. We are going to be a little short, still, a little tight as we exit the year, but are encouraged by that.
Keith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you, guys.
Jonathan Neilson: Thanks, Keith. Operator, next question, please.

Brent Thill, Jefferies: Thanks. Satya, on your comment about accelerating demand for cloud migrations, I’m curious if you could dig in and extrapolate a little more what you’re seeing there. Thank you.
Satya Nadella: Thanks, Brent. Yeah, I sort of think about three big things that are happening in the cloud, all at parallel, and there is also a relationship between them. One is, I’ll just say, the classic migration of whether it’s SQL, Windows Server. And so, that’s, again, got good steady state progress, because the reality is, I think everyone’s now, perhaps there’s another kick in the datacenter migrations, just because of the efficiency the cloud provides. That’s one part. The second piece is good data growth. You saw Postgres on Azure. I mean, forgetting SQL Server, Postgres on Azure is growing. Cosmos is growing, the analytic stuff I talked about with Fabric. It’s even the others, whether it is Databricks or even Snowflake on Azure are growing. We feel very good about Fabric growth and our data growth. Then the cloud-native growth, this is, again, before we even get to AI, some of the core compute consumption of cloud-native players is also very healthy. It was healthy throughout the quarter. We projected to go moving forward as well. Then the thing to notice is the ratio, and I think we’ve mentioned this multiple times before. If you look underneath even ChatGPT, in fact, that team does a fantastic job of thinking about not only their growth in terms of AI accelerators they need. They use Cosmos DB. They use Postgres. They use core compute and storage. And so, there’s even a ratio between any AI workload in terms of AI accelerator to others. Those are the four pockets, I would say, or four different trend lines, which all have a relationship with each other. And if I step back, and Amy and I talk a lot about this, this time around, there’s nothing certain for sure in the future, except for one thing, which is our largest business is our infrastructure business. And the good news here is the next big platform shift builds on that. It’s not a complete rebuild, having gone through some of these platform shift, where you have to come out on the other side with a full rebuild. If there is good news here, it’s that we have a good business in Azure that continues to grow, and the new platform depends on that. We want to stay disciplined and execute super well on that.
Brent Thill: Thank you.
Jonathan Neilson: Thanks, Brent. Operator, next question, please.

Mark Moerdler, Bernstein: Thank you very much for taking my question, and I will reiterate what my peers have said. Congratulations on the great quarter. Satya and Amy, Microsoft is a very different business than it was during the last recession. Incredible job you’ve done. If we get into a recession, and I hope we don’t, how do you think about the stability, the sustainability, revenue volatility of Microsoft today, if we were to get into recession? Would the business react early to recession or late? Would a recession have a more shallow impact on revenue? Any thoughts would be appreciated.
Satya Nadella: Maybe I’ll start and then Amy should add, Mark. The way, at least, I think we will approach it is, quite frankly, be very focused on how we help our customers if there is any turbulence in the macro, because one of the things that we feel we can do, just because of the efficiencies of the cloud, and the footprint we have and the differentiated layers of the stack, from the SaaS application side to the infrastructure side, I think if you buy into the argument that software is the most malleable resource we have to fight any type of inflationary pressure or any type of growth pressure where you need to do more with less, I think we can be super helpful in that. And so, if anything, we would probably have more of that mindset is how do we make sure we are helping our customers? And then, of course, we’ll look to share gains.
Jonathan Neilson: Thanks, Mark. Operator, next question, please.

Karl Keirstead, UBS: Okay, thanks. A number of metrics to applaud, but I think the one that stands out to me is the 16 point growth rate lift to Azure from AI. Satya and Amy, I just wanted to ask if you could unpack that a little bit. Of course, you mentioned that you got a bit of a kicker from capacity coming online. But I’m a little bit more interested in where the demand came in above expectations, like what workload type. It’s hard for us to see that on the outside. Was it a surge in ChatGPT inference that landed in Azure? Was it an uptick in enterprise AI adoption? And Amy, do you think that 16 points could be higher in June? Thank you.
Amy Hood: Thanks, Karl, for the question. Just to provide some clarity, because I think your question implies something that we didn’t mean to imply on the call. First, the real outperformance in Azure this quarter was in our non-AI business. Then to talk about the AI business, really what was better was precisely what we said. We talked about this. We knew Q3 that we had really matched supply and demand pretty carefully, and so didn’t expect to do much better than we had guided to on the AI side. We’ve been quite consistent on that. The only real up side we saw on the AI side of the business was that we were able to deliver supply early to a number of customers. And being able to do that throughout the quarter creates quite a good benefit to us. But the majority of our outperformance versus where we had expected to be was on the non-AI piece of the business.
Jonathan Neilson: Thanks, Karl. Operator, next question, please.

Kash Rangan, Goldman Sachs: Hi, thank you very much. One question for Amy. You’ve said in the past that you can attain better and better capital efficiency with the Cloud business, and probably Cloud and AI business. Where do you stand today, Amy? Maybe, Satya, you can opine as well, that you’ve said before that you can slow down your CapEx growth rate, while still accelerate Azure, which includes AI. Can we get a market to market on that? Thank you.
Amy Hood: Maybe I’ll start, Kash, and let Satya add on, because I really think when you go back and read some of Satya’s comments on how the S-curves build on themselves, that’s actually the levers that go in to the answer of the question that you’re asking. And so, the way, of course, you’ve seen that historically is right when we went through the prior cloud transitions, you see CapEx accelerate. You build out datacenter footprints. You slowly fill CPU capacity. And over time, you see software efficiencies and hardware efficiencies build on themselves. And you saw that process for us, for, goodness, now, quite a long time. And what Satya’s talking about is how quickly that’s happening on the AI side of the business, and you add to that model diversity. Think about the same levers, plus model efficiency, those compound. Now, the one thing that’s a little different this time is just the pace. And so, when you’re seeing that happen, pace in terms of efficiency time, but also pace in terms of the buildout, so it can mask some of the progress. But we are working hard across all of the teams, hardware, software, even the build teams, to get things in place as quickly as possible, dock to live times. All of that is improving, and all of that actually is benefiting us. And I’ll go ahead and say our margins on the AI side of the business are better than they were at this point, by far than when we went through the same transition in the server to cloud transition.
Satya Nadella: Yeah, I mean, I think at a macro level, I think the way to think about this is, you can ask the question, what’s the difference between a hosting business and a hyperscale business? It’s software. That’s, I think, the gist of it. Yes, for sure, it’s a capital intensive business, but capital efficiency comes from that system wide software optimization. And that’s what makes the hyperscale business attractive, and that’s what we want to just keep executing super well on.
Kash Rangan: Super, Thanks so much.
Jonathan Neilson: Thanks, Kash. Operator, next question, please.

Mark Murphy, JPMorgan: Thank you so much. Satya, you had commented recently that the DeepSeek moment is a real thing, and you had said that software efficiencies mean that the fleet will be aged for a longer time. Can you comment on how those advances are affecting the pace and volume of AI experimentation and activity in the marketplace? And Amy, could we start to consider the possibility that software enhancements might extend the useful life assumption that you’re using for GPUs, or is it a little premature to be thinking that way?
Satya Nadella: Yeah. First of all, I think some of the work that actually, OpenAI first pioneered and did with all of the reasoning models, and of course, DeepSeek has added to it and done good work as well, and others as well, the idea that you can have test time compute plus pre-training, and then some of the great optimization at inference time that has all happened has proven out. I mean, if you look at it, I would say for every Moore’s Law change and movement, there’s probably a 10x improvement because of software. That’s what’s happening with these models. Some of it comes from model architecture. Some of that comes from data efficiency, compute efficiency, and what have you. That’s what we are riding, and we feel that, all up, when you have a commodity that is getting that better, then the question is, how do you build out a fleet that’s super balanced, so that then the workloads can be built and can, in fact, take advantage of that efficiency at the underlying infrastructure? I mean, it’s kind of like virtualization. What is the difference between servers and, again, client server with virtualization? It was efficiency. What is the difference between virtualization and cloud? It was efficiency. What is the difference between this generation of cloud and AI? It’s efficiency. The more you can kind of continue to think about software driving that efficiency is what drives demand, ultimately.
Amy Hood: And to your specific question, in terms of thinking about the depreciable life of an asset, we like to have a long history before we make any of those changes. We’re focused on getting every bit of useful life we can, of course, out of assets. But, to Satya’s point, that tends to be a software question more than a hardware one.
Mark Murphy: Thank you.
Jonathan Neilson: Thanks, Mark. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: [Operator instructions]
Kirk Materne, Evercore ISI: Yes, thanks very much, and congrats on a great quarter. Amy, you mentioned that the upside in Azure came from the non-AI services this time around. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about that. And I guess as you look forward, maybe what’s different this go round versus what we saw a few years ago, when, obviously, things like optimization weighed on the growth a little bit? It sounds like the product portfolio is much broader right now, but just wondering if you could add some color on that front. Thank you.
Amy Hood: Sure, and thanks for the question, Kirk. We know the non-AI. I talked a little bit about this. In general, we saw better than expected performance across our segments, but we saw acceleration in our largest customers. We call that the enterprise segment in general. And then in what we talked about of our scale notions, where we had some challenges in Q2, things were a little better. And we still have some work to do in our scale notions. And we’re encouraged by our progress. We’re excited to stay focused on that as, of course, we work through the final quarter of our fiscal year. By geo, the performance was pretty consistent. Satya actually highlighted some of the workloads that came in a little better than we thought. Obviously, just some good, consistent work on migration, good execution by the sales and partner teams, the data workloads he went through. And so, in general, Kirk, I wouldn’t say it’s anything beyond that. I do think it was improved execution. And I was happy to see it, but there’s still some work to do on our scale motions in particular.
Kirk Materne: Thank you.
Jonathan Neilson: Thanks, Kirk. Operator, we have time for one last question.
Operator: [Operator instructions]
Alex Zukin, Wolfe Research: Hey guys, thanks for squeezing me in, and again, just amazing. Congratulations on those Azure numbers, which I think are, quite honestly, just inspiring. Maybe, Amy, to the point that you’re making that the surprise factor was on the non-AI side of the house, and it sounds like there’s confidence in that continuing beyond. How much of that are you starting to see the pull in of the non-AI driven by the AI portion of Azure? And on the AI portion, specifically, as test time compute really just blows out kind of prior conceptions of scaling law challenges, how much does that change, potentially, the curve of the AI Azure growth as you go forward here over the next few quarters?
Amy Hood: Thanks, Alex. Let me, first of all, say I think we’ve talked about this quite a bit. It’s always a good chance to get to iterate this. It’s getting harder and harder to separate what an AI workload is from a non-AI workload. And we’ve talked about it this way, I think, in most instances, to make sure people understood that when we were accelerating all of our CapEx spend over the past two and a half or three years now, that people had confidence that we were turning that into revenue and product in a way that was transparent and that everyone could understand, really the goals that we had set for ourselves and for our partners and customers in terms of building product that turned to revenue. But if you take a step back from that, it’s that these workloads are being built, GPUs, CPUs, storage, network, all the same things. And so, I think really what we’re talking about is really how Satya talked about, in one of the earlier questions, we’re seeing digital natives. Digital natives build workloads. They do AI work. They do non-AI work. Do they tend to do that work in the same cloud? Lots of times. Sometimes it’s all in the same place, not all the time. But that relationship gets stronger and stronger as people pivot to more of AI heavy workloads. And so, I think you’re starting to see some of that relationship. I think we’ll continue to see that as AI workloads continue to get built and experimented with, and proof of concepts get expanded. And so, I think I mostly focus on the fact that together, we saw good performance in Q3 on Azure, Azure inclusive of both components, in terms of our execution, in terms of the field and partner teams, and backlog and conversion, and interesting workloads, and adding customer value, and solving real problems, and adding real value. And I think that’s probably, Alex, how I would approach that number, more than trying to separate it in the way that even we have talked about it, but for very different reasons.
Jonathan Neilson: Thanks, Alex. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today’s earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you all soon.
Satya Nadella: Thank you.
Amy Hood: Thank you.
