INTC,2024,1,2024-Q1-INTC,"Operator: Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Intel Corporation's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. 
 And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. John Pitzer, Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations. 
John Pitzer: Thank you, Jonathan. By now, you should have received a copy of the Q1 earnings release and earnings presentation, both of which are available on our Investor Relations website, intc.com. For those joining us online today, the earnings presentation is also available in our webcast window. 
 I'm joined today by our CEO, Pat Gelsinger; and our CFO, David Zinsner. In a moment, we will hear brief comments from both followed by a Q&A session. Before we begin, please note that today's discussion does contain forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such, are subject to various risks and uncertainties. It also contains reference to non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information to our investors. 
 Our earnings release, most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC provide more information on specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. They also provide additional information on our non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations where appropriate to corresponding GAAP financial measures. 
 With that, let me turn things over to Pat. 
Patrick Gelsinger: Thanks, John, and welcome, everyone. 
 We've reported solid Q1 results, delivering revenue in line and EPS above our guidance as we continue to focus on operating leverage and expense management. Our results reflect our disciplined approach on reducing costs as well as the steady progress we are making against our long-term priorities. While first half trends are modestly weaker than we originally anticipated, they are consistent with what others have said and also reflect some of our own near-term supply constraints. We continue to see Q1 as the bottom, and we expect sequential revenue growth to strengthen throughout the year and into 2025, underpinned by: one, the beginnings of an enterprise refresh cycle and growing momentum for AI PCs; two, a data center recovery with a return to more normal CPU buying patterns and ramping of our accelerator offerings; and three, cyclical recoveries in NEX, Mobileye and Altera. 
 We had an extremely productive Q1 and achieved several important milestones along our journey to reposition the company for improved execution, competitiveness and perhaps, most importantly, financial results. We hosted our first-ever Intel foundry Direct Connect, which drew nearly 300 partners, customers and potential customers to hear about the momentum we are building with our foundry offerings. We were pleased to announce Microsoft as our fifth Intel 18A customer. We also updated our lifetime deal value to greater than $15 billion and extended our road map with Intel 14A, the first process node in the industry to use High NA EUV technology. 
 Shortly following Direct Connect, we were thrilled to join with President Biden and Commerce Secretary Raimondo to announce our position as the National Semiconductor Champion along with the single largest award from the CHIPS and Science Act of more than $45 billion of proposed grants, tax incentives and loans. During the second week of April, we brought together more than 1,000 of our top customers and partners at Intel Vision 2024, where we introduced our next-generation Gaudi 3 accelerator. We were joined by Naver, Dell, Bosch, Supermicro and Roche, among many others who shared how they are benefiting from Intel solutions. 
 Vision went straight into Open Source Summit, where we led the launch of the open platform for enterprise AI project. This industry initiative aims to accelerate gen AI deployments in what will be the largest market for AI applications, starting with retrieval augmented generation, or REG. Our Xeon plus Gaudi use cases, along with our established enterprise ecosystem, have a big role to play here. 
 Lastly, we hosted the industry's first Sustainability Summit, underscoring our deep commitment to building a more geographically diverse, resilient, trusted and of course, sustainable supply chain for semiconductors. We are proud of our leadership position in chemical conservation, renewable energy and water reclamation. Our accomplishments year-to-date build on all the work we have done to execute on the strategy I laid out when I rejoined the company 3 years ago. Job #1 was to accelerate our efforts to close the technology gap that was created by over a decade of underinvestment. 
 The heart of Phase 1 was 5 nodes in 4 years. The rallying cry was toured. It combined accelerating our node transitions with improving our product execution and cadence to regain customer trust. We have rebuilt our Grovian culture and execution engine and are on track to completing our 5 nodes 4-year goal, which many of our stakeholders thought impossible at inception. In so doing, we are in a unique position with at-scale EUV technology, Western-based capacity and at the very least, a level playing field with the market leader. Intel 20A, which helps pave the way for Intel 18A, begins production ramp in the second half of this year with Arrow Lake. We expect to release the 1.0 PDK for Intel 18A this quarter. Furthermore, our lead products, Clearwater Forest and Panther Lake, are already in fab, and we expect to begin production ramp of the Intel 18A in these products in the first half of '25 for product release in the middle of next year. 
 Given this progress, now is the time to turn our focus to matching technology leadership with a competitive cost structure. Establishing a founder relationship between our products group and our manufacturing group was a critical step to achieve better structural cost. This quarter, we officially transitioned to our new operating model and introduced Intel products and Intel Foundry. Today, for the first time, we are reporting our results to reflect the new way in which we are running the company. Separating the internal financial reporting between Intel Foundry and Intel products was a critical step needed to provide transparency, accountability and the proper incentives to allow both groups to make better decisions to optimize their own cost structures. 
 This change also provided the added benefit of giving more transparency to our outside owners, we knew that the day 1 P&L for Intel foundry was going to spark debate, but we also knew it was important to establish a baseline and provide a target model based on reasonable to conservative revenue and cost assumptions that we have a high degree of confidence we will achieve. I'm going to reiterate that point so it is heard and understood. Our target model is reasonable, conservative and reflects a high degree of confidence in our ability to deliver. And you can rest assured that we will be working hard to beat these targets. If we can move faster and do better, we will, and our new operating model is already catalyzing change in driving efficiencies across the organization. 
 Let me highlight 3 important aspects of our business and our strategy that is underscored by the new model. First, with Intel products, we have exposed a solid fabless franchise with established, powerful and hard to displace installed base and ecosystem across enterprise, consumer and edge that provide meaningful benefits to our customers and partners. Intel products is a solidly profitable business today despite just recently emerging from a semiconductor downturn and still competing with legacy process technology. That is changing rapidly as we ramp Intel 3 in 2024 and Intel 18A in 2025. 
 We then claim, we are defining and leading the AI PC category. IDC indicates the overall PC market is now expanding. And as stated earlier, as standards emerge and applications begin to take advantage of new AI embedded capabilities, we see demand signals improving, especially in second half of the year, helped by a likely corporate refresh. 
 Our Core Ultra ramp, led by Meteor Lake, continues to accelerate beyond our original expectation, with units expected to double sequentially in Q2, limited only by our supply of wafer-level assembly. Improving second half Meteor Lake supply, and the addition of Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake later this year, will allow us to ship in excess of our original 40 million AI PC CPU target in 2024. Next year, with Panther Lake, we will extend our lead with Intel 18A and further product enhancements. Our share position is strong and continues to strengthen as we execute on our product road map. Within DC AI, as committed, we have achieved product release on our first Intel 3 server product, the first-generation E-Core Xeon 6, codename Sierra Forest. 
 The next-generation P-Core Xeon 6 product, Granite Rapids, will be released in Q3. At Vision, we demonstrated a 70 billion parameter model running natively on Xeon 6 with good performance. We continue to expect share trends to stabilize this year before improving in 2025. While budgets are still being prioritized to generative AI build-out, where we have a strong position in the head node, customer conversations continue to show improving signs for traditional CPU refresh starting in late Q2 and into the second half. Our first Intel 18A product, Clearwater Forest, is slated to launch next year and will allow us to accelerate share gains. Our Gaudi 3 launch gave us a strong offering to improve our position in accelerated computing for the data center and cloud. 
 We now expect over $500 million in accelerated revenue in second half of 2024, with increasing momentum into 2025 based on Gaudi 3's vastly superior TCO as well as our own expanding supply. In addition, we are finding good traction with the Intel Developer Cloud with customers onboarding with this platform, including Dell and Zeekr, our largest IDC win to date. We are encouraged by our progress but far from satisfied. Lastly, within NEX, the business has stabilized and beat our Q1 targets with channel inventories approaching normal levels and business acceleration expected through the year as a result. We also recently announced our plans for scale up and scale out Ethernet-based AI networking delivered as a discrete NIC and chiplets for AI foundry customers with numerous key providers in the industry and market standardization through the Ultra Ethernet Consortium. 
 So that is Intel products, good momentum and a lot for us to build on. Let me turn to Intel Foundry. We are executing on our strategy to drive meaningful improvement in profitability over time. We are obviously not there yet, given the large upfront investment we needed to build out this business. But we always said this was going to be a multiyear plan, and we are right on track with where we expect it to be right now. As we discussed during our webinar at the beginning of the month, the transition from pre-EUV wafers to post-EUV wafers is a powerful tailwind for us. We expect our blended average wafer pricing to grow 3x faster than cost over the decade, driving significant margin expansion. 
 In addition, more competitive wafers will allow us to bring home many of the tiles that today are being manufactured at external foundries. Both dynamics are in our control and not dependent on revenue growth and are key elements to drive the business to breakeven, more than doubling our current earnings power at the Intel consolidated level. Of course, more competitive wafers combined with our position as the only company manufacturing with leading-edge wafers outside of Asia, is drawing strong interest from potential external customers. It is important to note that our leadership in advanced packaging creates more value in our wafer technologies and wafer-level assembly, and base die opportunities further fill our factories and extend the useful life of our tools for increased financial returns. 
 I am pleased to announce that this quarter, we signed another meaningful customer on Intel 18A, bringing our total to 6. A leader in the aerospace and defense industry, this customer chose Intel Foundry based not only on the process technology benefits of Intel 18A, but also because of their desire to have a secure U.S.-only supply base. Just this week, we were very pleased to announce that the DoD awarded Intel Foundry Phase III of the RAMP-C program, which we are confident will lead to additional federal aerospace and defense customers. 
 More broadly, we are seeing growing interest in Intel 18A and we continue to have a strong pipeline of nearly 50 test chips. The near-term interest in Intel Foundry continues to be strongest with advanced packaging, which now includes engagements with nearly every foundry customer in the industry, including 5 design awards. While we are highly focused on improving the near-term profitability of Intel Foundry, it is also important that we keep sight of the long-term opportunity here. 
 The foundry market is expected to grow from $110 billion today to $240 billion by 2030, with almost 90% of the growth coming from EUV nodes and advanced packaging. Given this backdrop, we have clear line of sight to becoming the largest system foundry for the AI era and the second largest overall by 2030, building on our EUV High-NA process technology leadership in advanced packaging, manufacturing capacity, our systems expertise and the surge in AI demand. Put it another way, our $15 billion of external revenue embedded in our Intel Foundry target model would represent less than 15% of the leading edge foundry market. It is not a question of if but when Intel Foundry achieves escape velocity. And every day, we are proving to the market that Intel Foundry is a resilient, sustainable and trusted alternative to serve a semi market on a path to top $1 trillion by the end of the decade. 
 Let me wrap up by speaking to our All Other category, where our #1 priority is to unlock shareholder value. This quarter, we formally rebranded our Programmable Solutions Group, Altera, an Intel company. We look forward to bringing in a private equity partner this year to help prepare the company for an IPO in the coming years. This puts Altera on a similar path as Mobileye. We are excited about the future of both companies. By providing them with separation and autonomy, we believe we enhance their ability to capitalize on their growth opportunities in their respective market and accelerate their path to create value. Combined with IMS, our mask writing equipment business, we believe these 3 assets represent more than 1/4 of our overall market value today. Along with a solid Intel products franchise and an Intel Foundry business rapidly approaching $100 billion in net tangible assets, we see the opportunity to unlock significant value for our shareholders as we meet our financial commitments, stand up Intel Foundry and drive it to profitability and further leverage our opportunity in AI. So overall, I'll say that there's a lot for us to build on coming out of Q1. We are systematically executing to our strategy, and we are making steady progress. We are maniacally focused on executional excellence and fiscal discipline and we are relentless in our drive to regain process leadership and bring next-generation solutions to solve our customers' hardest problems. 
 All of this gives me confidence in where we are headed. Yes, we have a lot of hard work in front of us, but we know what we need to do and the payoff will be significant in the end. Semiconductors are the currency that will drive the global economy for decades to come. We are one of 2, maybe 3 companies in the world that can continue to enable next-generation chip technologies and the only one that has Western capacity and R&D, and we will participate in the entire AI market. Quarter-by-quarter, we are positioning ourselves well to capitalize on the immense opportunities ahead. 
 With that, let me turn things over to Dave. 
David Zinsner: Thank you, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. 
 We delivered solid results in the quarter with revenue finishing in line and gross margin and EPS, again beating guidance. Forward-looking demand signals in our core markets improved at a measured pace through the first quarter, and we expect to deliver full year revenue and EPS growth in 2024, with the pace of revenue growth accelerating in the second half. First quarter revenue was $12.7 billion, up 9% year-over-year and just above the midpoint of our guidance, with product segments performing in line with expectations. Intel Products delivered 17% year-over-year growth, offset by inventory headwinds impacting Mobileye, Altera and our 5G customers as well as the sunsetting of several noncore lines of business including the traditional packaging business within Intel Foundry. 
 These noncore revenue headwinds drove a sequential decline of just over $1 billion, in line with our Q1 guidance. Gross margin was 45.1%, 60 basis points above guidance, and EPS of $0.18 beat guidance by $0.05 on operating spending discipline and strong sell-through of previously reserved inventory. 
 Q1 operating cash flow was negative $1.2 billion. Net CapEx was $5 billion, resulting in an adjusted free cash flow of negative $6.2 billion and we paid dividends of $0.5 billion in the quarter. We expect Q1 to be the low point for adjusted free cash flow, driven by seasonal factors, including timing of annual bonus payments, along with upsides from larger capital offsets expected in the second half. 
 As Pat mentioned, this is our first quarter reporting in the new operating segments. The revised structure creates a foundry relationship between manufacturing and our products groups with Intel Products purchasing wafers and services from Intel Foundry at fair market prices. This quarter represents another important step in our transformation, with increased transparency and accountability across all layers of the organization, which is already having a positive impact on decision-making efficiencies and financial discipline. 
 As I talk about our results, I'll categorize them between Intel Products, Intel Foundry and All Other, with the All Other category, including the results of Mobileye and Altera. Additional detail can be found in our earnings release and SEC filings. Intel Products revenue was $11.9 billion, up 17% year-over-year. The client business grew by more than 30% year-over-year with a strong product portfolio and share position and significantly improved customer inventory levels. The data center and AI business contributed 5% year-over-year growth, driven by higher Xeon ASPs and improved enterprise demand. 
 NEX revenue declined 8% year-over-year. As discussed last quarter, we saw significant declines in the 5G market, partially offset by approximately 10% year-over-year growth in our network and edge markets, which we expect to continue to recover through the year. Intel Products' operating profit expanded by more than $2.1 billion year-over-year, driven by higher revenue, better sell-through of reserved inventory and operating spending discipline, resulting in an operating margin of approximately 28% in the quarter. 
 Intel foundry revenue was $4.4 billion, down 10% year-over-year on lower back-end services and sample revenue, along with lower IMS tool sales. In addition, wafer volume was modestly higher in the quarter, with ASPs modestly down, driven by pricing for mature nodes. Operating profit declined by approximately $100 million year-over-year, with lower revenue being partially offset by improved factory utilization. 
 Op margin declined significantly quarter-over-quarter, driven by higher start-up costs and the conclusion of the traditional packaging business impacting revenue. The foundry P&L will remain challenged through the year, and we expect operating margins to trough in 2024 as start-up costs associated with 5 nodes in 4 years peak and the P&L absorbs an expected increase of roughly $2 billion in depreciation. Beyond 2024, as volume begins to shift toward leadership manufacturing nodes with a competitive cost structure scale improves, including the return of compute tiles to internal process nodes and our efficiency actions begin to flow through the P&L, we expect to see rapid profitability improvement. 
 Mobileye revenue of $239 million and an operating loss of $68 million were both down meaningfully year-over-year due to a well-publicized drawdown of iQ customer inventory. Mobileye reiterated full year guidance on their earnings call this morning. With the inventory digestion process on track, financial results are expected to recover quickly. Altera revenue was $342 million, down significantly year-over-year, with results impacted by the industry-wide inventory digestion following supply constraints in 2022 and '23. Altera's $39 million operating loss is a result of lower revenue and spending associated with standing up Altera as a stand-alone company. 
 We continue to expect Altera to exit 2024 at a $2 billion revenue run rate as inventory positions normalize. I want to acknowledge the hard work and focused execution across the company to transition our systems and processes to our new reporting structure. We're already seeing the results of the increased transparency catalyzing change and driving efficiencies across the company. 
 Now turning to our Q2 guidance. We expect revenue of $12.5 billion to $13.5 billion in the second quarter, with the midpoint aligned to typical seasonal growth. At the midpoint of $13 billion, we expect gross margin of approximately 43.5%, with a tax rate of 13% and EPS of $0.10, all on a non-GAAP basis. We see the client and data center business roughly flat to Q1 results at the low end of seasonal. Q2 client revenue is constrained by wafer-level assembly supply, which is impacting our ability to meet demand for our Core Ultra-based AI PCs. We do expect sequential growth from Mobileye, NEX and foundry services. 
 As we look beyond Q2 guidance, we expect growth across all segments in the second half of the year, led by improved demand for general purpose servers from both cloud and enterprise customers and increased core ultra assembly capacity to support a growing PC TAM, driven by enterprise refresh and the AI PC. We should also see accelerating growth from our network and edge businesses, a return to growth for Altera and a meaningful Gaudi ramp in the second half. 
 Despite 2024 representing the peak for 5 node and 4-year driven factory start-up costs, we expect roughly 200 basis points of FY '24 gross margin improvement compared to FY '23. Our net capital intensity forecast of mid-30s as a percent of revenue across 2023 and 2024 in aggregate remains unchanged. With significant capital offsets expected to land in the second half of the year, we continue to expect approximately neutral 2024 adjusted free cash flow. While first half demand signals have been a bit weaker, Q1 played out largely in line with our expectations. We achieved several important milestones towards our IDM 2.0 vision, and we're participating in a large and growing TAM with encouraging market signals for the second half of the year and into 2025. By capturing margin at both the foundry level and the fabless product level, we have margin stacking advantage unique in the industry. We are 3 years into our transformation, and 2024 represents the steepest part of the climb, with 5 node and 4-year start-up cost peaking and the majority of our volume on pre-EUV process nodes with uncompetitive economics. However, as we crest the hill and look toward the next few years, we have strong wins at our back and a clear path to achieving the mid- and long-term financial targets we laid out earlier this month. 
 With that, let me turn the call back over to John. 
John Pitzer: Thank you, Dave. We will now transition to the Q&A portion of our call. [Operator Instructions] With that, Jonathan, can we take the first question? 
Operator: And our first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. 
Ross Seymore: I guess for my first question, I wanted to dive into the demand side of the equation. What was weaker in the near term than you had expected? And much more importantly, it seems like the back half you're going to have double-digit sequential growth in largely both quarters, so that's significantly above seasonal. I know you went through some of the reasons at a high level, but can you dive a little bit deeper into what gives you that level of confidence in the second half ramp? 
Patrick Gelsinger: Yes. Starting out, so Ross, thanks for the question. I'll just say the market was weaker. You've seen that in a number of others that have commented as well. So I'll say somewhat across the board a bit. We've seen that, cloud customers, enterprise, across geos. So I'll just say a bit weaker demand, right, we'll just say at the low end of seasonality Q1 to Q2 that we saw. And as we go into the second half of the year, we're engaging deeply with our customers today, our OEM partners, and we just see strength across the board, right? 
 Part of that is driven by our unique product position, some of it driven by the market characteristics and client, AI PC and a second half Windows upgrade cycle, we believe, underway and Core Ultra is hot. And as we said, even in Q2, we're racing -- we're meeting all of our commitments, but not all of the upside requests that we're seeing from customers. So we see a very strong AI PC outlook in the data center. As we bring in our new products, we're seeing ASPs increase very healthy on our data center products and with products like CR4 that we just went to production with this week on Intel 3, we're seeing improved product position as well for competitiveness. 
 We have the $0.5 billion of Gaudi, right? And most of that is second half loaded. And the All Other businesses coming out of inventory positions in Altera and Mobileye and NEX, all of those improved first half to second half as well. And then incremental, I'll just say, Intel Foundry, every quarter from here until the decade and we're seeing improvement in the Intel Foundry. And one by one, we're seeing all of those business improvements both on revenue and margin improvements over time. So we feel very comfortable that the second half outlook is quite strong for the business, a first half a bit weaker, but we think it's very understandable, very explainable, and a second half outlook that will be very comfortable for every business across Intel growing and a lot of momentum as we go into '25. 
John Pitzer: Ross, do you have a quick follow-up? 
Ross Seymore: I do. Maybe for Dave, on the gross margin side, nice upside in the first quarter, but the drop in the second quarter is a little bit puzzling with revenues going up. So could you just talk a little bit about that second quarter drop and then the confidence in the rebound in the second half? Is that just revenue driven in the second half? Or what's the key metrics there, please? 
David Zinsner: Yes. Good. Thanks, Ross. Maybe start with Q1 because it somewhat explains Q2. We had better sell-through of product. I hadn't even mentioned Meteor Lake strength. That better sell-through was on previously reserved material. And so we just saw some upside in gross margins because of that. We had a little bit more of a flattish plan between Q1 and Q2 in terms of how that would flow through. And so it kind of pulled some of the benefit of gross margin improvement we would have seen in Q2 and kind of pulled it into Q1. So that was part of it. 
 The second part is, as we talked about, this year was going to be a heavy year for start-up cost for us. And it really shows up more meaningfully in the second quarter versus the first quarter. And so that puts a little added pressure on gross margins. As you point out, the upside in the revenue, we will have good fall-through in Q3 and Q4, that will help lift the gross margins from where they are today. And then on top of that, we'll see some areas which have high gross margins, helping us like, for example, Mobileye, we get good gross margin for Mobileye and the strength that we'll see through the year there and products like that will also help drive better gross margins in the back half of the year. 
 As we look into '25, I think we'll have better gross margins than '25 than we had in '24. So this should be an ongoing story for us on the gross margin front. And as you know, we're driving to get to kind of mid-50s gross margins by the midpoint between now and 2030 and ultimately getting to 60%. Of course, revenue will be part of that. But a lot of that is within our control. It's things like 18A wafer pricing growing at 3x the cost of 18A that will help drive margins. The pull-in of tiles, as Pat mentioned, internally is going to drive better gross margins for us over time. All of what we're doing in terms of resegmenting new businesses to drive better decision-making, that better decision-making will translate into significant cost improvements for us, which should also be a meaningful driver for gross margins over time as well. And of course, as Pat mentioned, we're happy to get the CHIPS announcement out. And of course, that, coupled with what we expect from the EU and the investment tax credit will also be major tailwinds on gross margins over a long-term basis. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes from Melius. 
Benjamin Reitzes: Appreciate the chance to ask a question here. Pat, can you talk a little bit more about servers in the data center? There was talk of a bottom there in previous discussions. How do you see that kind of going throughout the year in light of your 2Q guidance? And what's the catalyst for the pickup there? 
Patrick Gelsinger: Yes. Thank you, Ben. And obviously, as we look at our position in the data center, I'll just say we're stabilizing. And with that, we're improving our competitiveness. We also see, as I mentioned in the comments, that the ASPs are going up comfortably as well. So socket fairly stable through the year, but the ASP per socket with increased core count improves our position. And then new products like Sierra Forest or Xeon Gen 6 product, definitely gives us power performance capabilities. So overall, we're seeing a very healthy growth rate, mid-20s as we go through the year. We're also seeing increasing interest in the AI capabilities of Xeon. And we're winning head node positions, and we're seeing pretty extraordinary performance at Vision. 
 We talked about the ability to now run 70 billion parameter models directly on Xeon. And these type of capabilities, say, for a lot of enterprise use cases, Xeon is a very strong product. And as we laid out at Vision, the ability for Xeon plus Gaudi to start positioning this open platform for enterprise AI is a very strong position for us. So overall, we feel like we're on a solid trajectory into a market that even though it's been dominated by the gen AI theme as enterprises, our OEMs and ODMs are communicating, there's growth here in servers. And we now have a much better product position, improving ASPs and a better overall positioning in AI for a lot of these use cases where it's Xeon CPU plus GPU and accelerator. 
John Pitzer: Ben, do you have a quick follow-up? 
Benjamin Reitzes: Yes. Thanks. Can we just double-click also on Gaudi, $500 million in the back half of the year? I think you previously talked about a couple of billion in the pipeline. What does that say about your yield to revenue on an annualized basis with AI? And is there an update on the pipeline and your confidence there heading into 2025 on the accelerator front? 
Patrick Gelsinger: Yes. Thanks, Ben. And obviously, pipeline converting into revenue, revenue is much more meaningful and as we said, greater than $500 million for the year, and that's obviously quarter-on-quarter accelerating rapidly, which also gives a great indication for the business in '25 as well. At our Vision event, we had over 20 customers publicly describing their embrace of Gaudi 2 and Gaudi 3. And I was super pleased to see the breadth of those customers. It was CSPs like Naver and Ola and IBM Cloud. It was ISVs like Zeekr, right, coming on board, but maybe most importantly, enterprise customers. 
 And ultimately, gen AI training, okay, creating models, but enterprises are going to use models, and that's where our TCO benefits. The ability for us to action customers' data in their enterprise environment is so powerful and customers like Bosch were coming forward and Roche to be able to demonstrate the true benefits of Gaudi and Xeon plus Gaudi. The road map is in good shape. The Gaudi 3 Falcon Shores in '25. We're also seeing that the industry wants to open alternatives. And we announced our AI networking initiative, Ultra Ethernet Consortium standardizing on scale up and scale out to Ethernet, increasing work for abstract levels of AI development with PyTorch and the embrace of the open platform for enterprise AI that we rolled out. All of those taken together, the industry is looking for open enterprise alternatives for regenerative AI deployment and Intel are quite well positioned, and we're starting to really see that uptake in our Accelerator and Xeon pipeline now. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. 
Joseph Moore: I wonder if you could talk to the server road map. It sounds like you're confirming the time frame for both Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids. Can you talk about -- is there demand for the Sierra Forest product as well? Do you expect that to be bifurcated where you see demand for both? And then how quickly will you see those products come to volume? 
Patrick Gelsinger: Yes. So Sierra Forest, our first Xeon 6 product on Intel 3, and I'm super proud, right? Now we have a leadership process technology back on American soil for the first time in a decade. This is really exciting. And Sierra Forest, high core count, 144, 288 core product, very focused on power, performance, efficiency, and we do see a good pipeline of customers and a good pipeline of, I'll say, socket win backs because the area of power performance has been an area that we've been carrying a deficit, being on an older node. And now that we're on leadership nodes, we definitely see share gains for that. 
 Of course, Granite Rapids, which will come in Q3, the Xeon 6 P-Core part is much more the bread and butter of the Xeon family. So we do see that being a stronger element to the portfolio this year as we haven't been participating in the power performance sockets as aggressively lately, and Sierra Forest gives us that tool. So it really is a one-two punch, as we've described. With Granite coming in Q3 and a volume ramp on Intel 3 with that, we feel we have a very good product line. 
 Next year is Clearwater Forest, the second generation of the E-core part, the leadership position on 18A in the server market, a very strong product for us, unquestioned leadership and power performance, so I believe that's a great opportunity for us to gain share again in the data center. So the road map is healthy. The execution is strong, and we're rebuilding customer trust. They're looking at us now and saying, ""Oh, Intel is back."" And we're quite excited by that. And then beyond that, building the volume, building the confidence and the momentum for traditional use cases as well as the AI use cases, as I just referred on Ben's question as well. 
John Pitzer: Joe, do you have a quick follow-up? 
Joseph Moore: Yes, I do. Thank you. On the foundry webinar, you had sort of talked about Intel 3 volume being kind of more of an inflection next year. Does that mean it was in server that these Intel 3 products are sort of get to volume crossover kind of some point next year? Or could we see -- obviously, the leadership you just talked about is important. What's kind of keeping you from getting those products ramping in the second half? 
Patrick Gelsinger: Yes, Joe, thank you. And servers always just take a while to ramp. Customers bring them in, they qualify them, they test them because they're generally putting these things at scale. So there's just an adoption cycle for server products. And the numbers that I'm holding my team accountable for are some of the most aggressive volume ramps that we've ever achieved on server products. So we're driving them very hard. That said, in terms of the total wafer volume this year, right, it's dominated by Intel 7. And the Intel 4 and 3 wafer volumes become much more prominent next year, and that's what I was communicating on the webinar. 
 But as we go through the year, you're going to start to see the wafer ASPs pick up as a result of Intel 4, 3 ramping at much better ASP points, better margins associated with those, and they will become much more prominent in the foundry P&L next year. But these are production ramps that are already underway on Intel 3. The Intel 4 ramp already underway. We began that second half of last year. So these wafer ramps are underway with volume productions, volume products that we're bringing to the marketplace, very confident in our ability. And then, of course, 18A as we deliver the PDK for that in Q2, the 1.0 PDK and we'll begin the volume ramps on Clearwater Forest and Panther Lake in the first half of next year for those products coming out. So we feel very comfortable with that overall picture that we've laid out. So thank you, Joe. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho Securities. 
Vijay Rakesh: Just a quick question on the Grand Rapids, any thoughts on the timing? And do you expect to regain some computing share, server share there with those ramps? 
Patrick Gelsinger: Yes. Thanks, Vijay. I'm building a little bit on the last question. Granite Rapids will come in Q3 of this year when we'll have the production release of that product. Same as -- it just takes some time for customers to get comfortable, qualify, and bring those products to marketplace. But Sierra Forest, Granite Rapids, these are much more competitive power performance products on Intel 3. So we see them stabilizing and then giving us opportunity to regain share. And as we go into next year, we expect that we're regaining share as we end this year and go into next year. These are great products and we're going to be ramping them very aggressively with our customers. 
John Pitzer: Vijay, do you have a follow-up? 
Vijay Rakesh: Yes. Thanks. Just on the GPU side, on the AI side, any parts on Falcon Shores? Any preliminary takes on that? How do you see that building out into '25? 
Patrick Gelsinger: Yes. And Gaudi 3 announcement this quarter, extremely well received. And as I mentioned already, 20-plus customers for Gaudi 2, 3, so we're seeing that build. Obviously, Falcon Shores will build on that momentum. We'll be bringing that late next year when Falcon Shores when we combine the great systolic performance of Gaudi 3 with a fully programmable architecture, and all of that comes together with Falcon Shores. And then we have a rich -- a very aggressive cadence of Falcon Shores products following that. We also added the Gaudi 3 PCIe card to it. This use case of Xeon plus an accelerator or Gaudi accelerator is getting very good response from customers as well. So we'll be bringing that out later this year. But the real story is delivering the TCO value, delivering the enterprise use cases. Falcon Shores will just build on the momentum that we're establishing with Gaudi 2 and 3.
 We also described customers coming on the Intel Developer Cloud, where we're getting these products very early in their life available for developers and enterprise customers. And customers like Zeekr, now our biggest Intel Developer Cloud win to date, are seeing the benefits. But the bigger story is how do we unleash the data assets of our enterprise customers, and that's things like the open platform for enterprise AI that we launched at Open Summit. So overall, a lot of good things happening to unleash the gen AI cycle for Intel. And of course, right, as we're doing this, AI is a hot market. We're participating across all of our segments, whether that's client, edge, enterprise or our foundry opportunities as well, delivering AI everywhere. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS Securities. 
Timothy Arcuri: Dave, I also wanted to ask about gross margin. You did say it's going to be better next year, but it is really whipping around a lot. And it looks like you sort of have to exit this year at 48 or maybe a little higher, which is already well above the 45.5 that you'll be at this year because you're guiding it up to 100 basis points. So I know you don't want to guide next year, but if you can even qualitatively help us, can you sustain those margins at that level? And I asked because last year, you sort of exited at 49% and then things crashed here during the first half of the year. So can you help us just think about what some of the puts and takes will be next year off of that high base if you're going to exit this year at? 
David Zinsner: Yes. Good question. So there will be additional start-up costs next year. We do think it on a percent of revenue basis, it will be lower. So that should help lift the margins. Of course, the expectation would be we see growth in revenue. That also should help. On top of that, we already are seeing good decision-making and changing decision-making around how we operate now under this new different business structure that we have at this point. A lot of that stuff doesn't actually show up in the P&L. We have all these decisions get made this year, but a lot of the decisions made -- sorry, a lot of the benefits to those decisions don't show up until next year and the year after. So we should see some benefit from that as well. 
 The other thing that kind of has whipped this -- our margins around a bit over the last few years has been this notion where we reserve material all the way up until the PRQ Pat just mentioned that Sierra Forest just PRQ-ed. So ordinarily, we take a whole bunch of reserves on Sierra Forest and then we would release them as we started shipping beyond the PRQ date. We won't be doing that going forward. So that should help adjust the volatility of the gross margin. So it will be more a function of revenue growth spending profile in the fabs, start-up costs that we have and the mix. 
John Pitzer: Tim, do you have a follow-up question? 
Timothy Arcuri: I do. I do, yes. So I want to ask about server CPU share. March -- I think the assumption for March was that service share was going to be pretty flat. So the question is, was that the case? And it sounds -- you sound maybe a little bit less optimistic, if I'm sort of reading between the lines, on share into the back half of the year, just given how long it takes these things to sort of impact your share. So your bullish outlook in the second half of the year, it sounds like it's more market-driven versus share driven. Can you just clarify that? 
Patrick Gelsinger: Well, overall, I like to say it's hard to predict, right, exactly how these will play out in light of the overall gen AI surge that we've seen. That said, products are good, right? We came into the year improving our market share position in the first quarter of the year. It does take time to ramp these new products. But better products, rebuilding trust with our customers that we're delivering on these and now hitting the, what we would call the early end of the cycles on these new products is giving us a lot of interest with the market and the customer. New use cases also demonstrated a 70 billion parameter model running natively on Granite Rapids at our Vision event, all of these just make us more and more confident in our business execution. 
 We're also seeing that we don't need SoC account to increase. The ASPs are going up with the core counts on our new leadership products as well. So all of those in a fairly optimistic view that we're getting from our OEMs and our channel partners for their view of upgrade cycles, building momentum from customers across the industry. 
 We feel very comfortable that we're stabilizing our position. We have been improving our road map, and we do expect to see share gains as we end the year and go into '25. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from Raymond James. 
Srinivas Pajjuri: My question is on the client side. I think, Pat, you mentioned something about supply constraints impacting your 2Q outlook. If you could provide some color as to what's causing those supply constraints and when do you expect those to ease as we, I guess, go into the second half. And then in terms of your AI PCs, I think you've been talking about $40 million or so potentially shipping this year. Could you maybe put that into some context as to how it actually helps Intel? Is it just higher ASPs? Is it higher margin? I would think that these products also come with higher costs. I just want to understand how we should think about the benefit to Intel as these AI PCs ramp? 
Patrick Gelsinger: Yes. Thank you. And overall, as we've seen, this is a hot product. The AI PC category, and we declared this as we finished last year, and we've just been incrementing up our AI PC or the Core Ultra product volumes throughout. We're meeting our customer commitments that we've had, but they've come back and asked for upside on multiple occasions across different submarkets. And we are racing to catch up to those upside request, and the constraint has been on the back end. Wafer-level assembly, one of the new capabilities that are part of Meteor Lake and our subsequent client products. So with that, we're working to catch up and build more wafer-level assembly capacity to meet those. 
 How does it help us? Hey, it's a new category. And that new category of products will generally be at higher ASPs as your question suggests. But we also think it's new use cases, and new use cases over time create a larger TAM. It creates an upgrade cycle that we're seeing. It creates new applications, and we're seeing essentially every ISV AI-ing their app, whether it's the communications capabilities of Zoom and team for translation and contextualization, whether it's new security capabilities with CrowdStrike and others finding new ways to do security on the client or it's way other creators and gamers taking advantage of this. 
 So we see that every PC is going to become an AI PC over time. And when you have that kind of cycle underway, Srini, everybody starts to say, ""Oh, how do I upgrade my platform?"" And we even demonstrated how we're using AI PC in the Intel factories now to improve yields and performance inside of our own factories. And as I've described it, it's like a Centrino moment, right, where Centrino ushered in WiFi at scale. We see the AI PC ushering in these new use cases at scale, and that's going to be great for the industry. But as the unquestioned market leader, right, the leader in the category creation, we think we're going to differentially benefit from the emergence of the AI PC. 
John Pitzer: Srini, do you have a follow-up? 
Srinivas Pajjuri: Yes, John. Thank you. And I guess my other question is on the other bucket. I think, Dave, you kind of talked about Altera potentially exiting the year at a $2 billion run rate from current levels. That's a pretty steep ramp. And also, I think you said next growth will accelerate over the next couple of quarters. So -- and given the telecom weakness out there that we're seeing, I'm just curious as to what's giving you that visibility or confidence. I mean is this driven by some new products? Or is it just the market recovering? Any color would be helpful. 
David Zinsner: Yes. On Altera, and this is not unprecedented when you see a massive work down of inventory, of course, that significantly impacts the revenue. But as that normalizes, then you start shipping to end consumption. So it's actually a pretty easy lift to get to the $2 billion mark once we're through the inventory digestion period. So I think we have high confidence on that. 
Patrick Gelsinger: And others have commented on their inventory cycles as well in the FPGA category. We have good products in the second half of the year, with Agilex starting to ramp as well. 
David Zinsner: And then on NEX, of course, that business also has gone through its own inventory adjustment. So we have good confidence around that reversing, which will help drive strength. And then some of the products that are more tailored to the AI space, of course, we'll see like, at NEX, for example, we'll see strength through the year. And so that should drive good revenue growth through the year as well. 
Patrick Gelsinger: Yes. And also in NEX, the AI networking products are strong, our IPU products, we're seeing strength in that area. So it's inventory as well as products. Even though, as your question suggests, the communication sector and the service providers, that is weaker through the year, but pretty much every aspect of their business in edge AI, as Dave said, is seeing strength as we go into the second half of the year and into '25. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America. 
Vivek Arya: Pat, just a conceptual question. In a gen AI server with accelerators, how important is the role of a specific CPU? Or is it easily interchangeable between yours or AMD's or ARM's? I guess the question is that if most of the workload is being done on the accelerator, does it really matter which CPU I use? And can that move towards gen AI servers, essentially shrink the TAM for x86 server CPUs, because a number of your cloud customers have announced ARM-based server alternatives. So I'm just curious, how do you think about that conversion over to gen AI and what that means for x86 server CPU TAM going forward? 
Patrick Gelsinger: Yes. Thanks, Vivek. And we spoke at our Vision event about use cases like RAG, retrievable augmented generation, where the LLMs might run on an accelerator, but all of the real-time data, all of the databases, all of the embedding is running on the CPU. So you're seeing all of these data environments, which are already running on Xeon and x86 being augmented with AI capabilities to feed an LLM. And I believe this whole area of RAG becomes one of the primary use cases for enterprise AI. And if you think about it, an LLM might be trained with 1-, 2-year old data, right? But many of the business processes and environment are real time, right? 
 You're not going to be retraining constantly. And that's where this area of the front-end database becomes very prominent. All of those databases run on x86 today. All of them are being enhanced for use cases like RAG. And that's why we see this unlock occurring because the data sits on-prem, the data sits in the x86 database environments that are all being enhanced against these use cases. And as we've shown, we don't need accelerators in some cases. We can run a 70 billion parameter model natively on Xeon with extraordinary TCO value for customers. And furthermore, all of the IT environments that enterprises run today, they have the security, they have the networking, they have the management technologies in place. 
 They don't need to upgrade or change those from any of those use cases. So we see a lot of opportunity here to build on the enterprise asset that we have with the Xeon franchise, but we're also going to be aggressively augmenting that. And we're commonly the head node, even when it's other accelerators are being used or other GPU is being used. And as we've described, Xeon plus Gaudi, we think is going to be a very powerful opportunity for enterprises. 
 So in many of those cases, we see this as a market lift, new applications, new use cases, new energy coming to the enterprise AI. Here we are in year 23 of the cloud, and while 60% of the workload has moved to the cloud, over 80% of the data remains on-prem under the control of the enterprise, much of that underutilized in businesses today. That's what gen AI is going to unlock. And a lot of that is going to happen through the x86 CPU and we see a powerful cycle emerging. And I would just point you back to what we described at Vision. This was a great event and many customers are seeing that value today. 
John Pitzer: Vivek, do you have a quick follow-up? 
Vivek Arya: Yes. Thank you. Maybe one for Dave on the potential operating loss, kind of how do we model that for the foundry business. So let's say, if I exclude the $2 billion in depreciation headwind, which I'm assuming is almost all going to your foundry business. What is the right way, Dave, to think about foundry operating income or loss this year? And how much of external foundry revenue are you expecting this year? 
David Zinsner: Yes. Good question. The operating losses will pick up. We roughly were at like 2-, 4-ish in the first quarter. It will pick up in the second quarter, given the start-up costs are increasing and I would say, be roughly in that range for the remainder of the year. And then what I said before is we see that improving then going into '25. And Pat's given me the order, he wants to see every quarter some improvement in the operating loss ultimately to get to breakeven midway through the point between now and 2030. And I think that is very achievable. Sorry, Vivek, what was the second question? 
John Pitzer: Vivek, are you still on? 
Operator: No, we've moved on. 
John Pitzer: Why don't we go to the next caller, Jonathan? 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay from Cowen. 
Matthew Ramsay: Yes. Pat, one question I've been getting from some folks, and I totally understand the lead times of starting some of these programs to put increased tile volume at external foundry, but you guys have made the progress on the 5 nodes in 4 years, as you highlighted multiple times. Is there any flex at all to bring back some of that external volume earlier? And I think it matters to some folks because it's a demonstration of you guys being able to ramp your own product to volume and to yield and to economics on 18A, which might give some indication to some external customers that are looking at your foundry business. So just any flex at all to pull that timeline in of sort of reshoring some of the external tiles? 
Patrick Gelsinger: Yes. Thanks, Matt. And largely, those decisions are made when the product decisions are made. So there's limited flexibility to move them around. And if you pick a process node for a certain tile, generally, that's the process node that it's on. So there's limited flexibility there. And many of those decisions, as we've highlighted before, Matt were literally made years ago, right? And those choices were made. 
 That said, we see the peak of our external tiles being this year and next year. And then the road map and the movement of those coming back begins to quite accelerate, even starting late next year. So the plan is clearly laid out. As we said, we see a couple of fabs' worth of capacity coming back into the Intel factory network as we move into '26 and beyond. So this becomes a significant driver. 
 We've also driven significant road map decisions against that improving profile of our products. And I'll say that begins in a very powerful way next year with Panther Lake and Clearwater Forest. Unquestioned, the best products in clients, the best products in server are now being built on Intel 18A. And as the question suggests, we see customers seeing that. Every foundry customer that we speak to, right, understanding where we are in our product and process cycle and the ability for them to essentially benefit from Intel as customer 0 in the foundry network. 
 So overall, this is feeling very good. We're on track to go accomplish that and the business model that we've laid out and Dave and I presented as we go through the decade shows a very healthy improvement in wafer ASP, wafer volume, foundry and these decisions are made, right? We're on track to both have the wafer foundry capabilities, have the process technology and the products to fill those factories. And that's why Dave and I have such confidence in the business model that we've laid out and the improvements that it will deliver as we go over the next several years together. 
John Pitzer: Matt, do you have a quick follow-up? 
Matthew Ramsay: Yes, John. Thank you. I wanted to ask a question about the AI accelerator road map. So you guys have Gaudi 3 that you talked about and Falcon Shores coming next year. And the hardware looks quite good. I wanted to ask a question about the software that goes on top of that for both -- well, really for inference but also for training. How do you feel about the software road map that you guys have in the AI space going forward? And how much compatibility, or uniqueness rather, is there to the software that runs on Gaudi 3 versus what will come on Falcon Shores and the forward road map? 
Patrick Gelsinger: Yes. Maybe 3 different points there. The first one is for inferencing, you need a whole lot less software compatibility, right? And as the market is more focused on inferencing going forward, if you can run the models, right, in the context of the databases and the other, so that portends and that's why we're seeing the strength that we're seeing right now, Matt, in these use cases. And clearly, some of the software compatibility issues of a GPU have led to the training environments that have been challenging for us. But now as customers get much more focused on enterprise use cases, inferencing TCO, we're finding a lot of strength in the offerings that we have. And as we've matured a number of customers now, we've worked through many of those use cases and getting quite a lot of acceptance of the software stack that we have with Gaudi 2 and 3. 
 We will have a very smooth and seamless upgrade from Gaudi 3 into Falcon Shores. But the powerful thing that will come with Falcon Shores is the full programmability that you'll see with the complete instruction set capabilities of Falcon Shores. And at that point, we will have no deficits for any of the use cases and much greater compatibility for the full range of AI capabilities. 
 The other thing that I emphasize is Xeon is a powerful capability with incredible programmable capabilities and we're finding these use cases like I described with the open platform for enterprise AI, RAG use cases is clearly beneficial there for us. So overall, we're feeling like the software story is coming together very nicely. And the entire industry is moving to higher level software abstraction such as Python and Triton. So they're moving away from any of these dependencies to an open software or platform. So the industry trends are in the right direction. Our maturity is in the right direction, and our software stack has gotten much more mature, and we'll have a very smooth upgrade to Falcon Shores. 
 So let me just close our time together and say thank you for the questions. Thanks for joining our call. We appreciate the update to give you on a very solid Q1. And we got a lot done in Q1 that gives us a great foundation for the future. We continue to drive our process and products and AI innovations and delivering on our process technology and leadership road map. If any of you were at COMPUTEX in a few months, I look forward to seeing you there. We have a number of products and offerings that we'll be announcing there as we continue our AI momentum and competitiveness. And as always, we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you very much. 
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",2024-04-25
INTC,2024,2,2024-Q2-INTC,"Operator: Thank you for standing by, and welcome to Intel Corporation's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now, I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. John Pitzer, Corporate Vice President of Investor Relations.
John Pitzer: Thank you, Jonathan. By now you should have received a copy of the Q2 earnings release and earnings presentation, both of which are available on our Investor Relations website, intc.com. For those joining us online today, the earnings presentation is also available in our webcast window. I am joined today by our CEO, Pat Gelsinger, and our CFO, David Zinsner. In a moment, we will hear brief comments from both followed by a Q&A session. Before we begin, please note that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such are subject to various risks and uncertainties. It also contains reference to non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information to our investors. Our earnings release, most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, and other filings with the SEC provide more information on specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. They also provide additional information on non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations where appropriate to our corresponding GAAP financial measures. With that, let me turn things over to Pat.
Patrick Gelsinger: Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Q2 profitability was disappointing despite continued progress on product and process roadmaps. With our new operating model firmly in place, we are accelerating actions to improve profitability and capital efficiency by more than $10 billion in 2025, which I will discuss shortly. For the quarter, we delivered sequential revenue growth in line with our forecast despite the unexpected timing of new export control restrictions announced in May. Q2 profitability was below our expectations due in part by our decision to more quickly ramp core Ultra AI CPUs as well as other selective actions we took to better position ourselves for future quarters, which Dave will address fully in his comments. We previously signaled that our investments to define and drive the AI PC category would pressure margins in the near term. We believe the trade-offs are worth it. The AI PC will grow from less than 10% of the market today to greater than 50% in 2026. We know today's investments will accelerate and extend our leadership and drive significant benefits in the years to come. Our efforts will culminate with the introduction of Panther Lake in second half of 2025. Panther Lake is our first client CPU on Intel 18A, a much more performant and cost-competitive process, which will additionally allow us to bring more of our tiles in-house, meaningfully improving our overall profitability. Another important driver of improved financial performance is the cost-reduction plan we announced today. This plan represents structural improvements enabled by our new operating model, which we are pulling forward to adjust to current business trends. Having separate financial reporting for Intel Products and Intel Foundry clarifies and focuses roles and responsibilities across the company. It also enables us to eliminate complexity and maximize the impact of our resources, taking a clean sheet view of the business is allowing us to take swift and broad-based actions beginning this quarter. As a result, we expect to drive a meaningful reduction in our spending and headcount beginning in the second half of this year. We are targeting a headcount reduction of greater than 15% by the end of 2025 with the majority of this action completed by the end of this year. We do not take this lightly and we have carefully considered the impact this will have on the Intel family. These are hard, but necessary decisions. Our actions will reduce OpEx to approximately $20 billion in 2024 and we see a bigger impact next year with 2025 OpEx targeted at $17.5 billion, more than 20% below prior estimates. We expect further benefits in 2026 with OpEx to decline in absolute dollars yet again. Even as we lower overall spending, we will continue to fund the investments needed to deliver our strategy. Our new operating model is also driving benefits to our capital requirements, giving us the transparency to more rigorously scrutinize every project and every dollar of capital. As a result, we now expect gross CapEx in 2024 to be between $25 billion and $27 billion. That is a reduction of over 20% from our plan entering the year and additionally reflects expectations for softer second half demand. Combined with strong execution of our smart capital strategy, including our second SCIP with Apollo, we expect net capital spending in 2024 of between $11 billion and $13 billion. These benefits will carry forward to next year as well. For 2025, gross capital spending is targeted between $20 billion and $23 billion and net capital spending between $12 billion to $14 billion. Increased capital efficiency has a positive impact to gross margins over time, but we will also accelerate improvements by generating roughly $1 billion of savings in non-variable cost of sales in 2025. Once again, these reductions do not impact our ability to execute our plan. We designed our smart capital strategy to enable us to conservatively manage the day-to-day business to trend line growth, while maintaining the operational flexibility to quickly and cost-effectively capture upside when it comes. We are taking the added step of suspending the dividend at the beginning of the fourth quarter, recognizing the importance of prioritizing liquidity to support the investments needed to execute our strategy. We reiterate our long-term commitment to a competitive dividend as cash flows improve to sustainably higher levels. Reductions across OpEx, CapEx, and cost of sales total well over $10 billion in direct savings in 2025 and provides clear line of sight to a sustainable model with the ongoing financial resources and liquidity needed to support our long-term strategy. We remain confident that we have and will continue to make the investments needed to drive long-term shareholder value and we view cost discipline as the compass that drives effective execution, helping teams stay on track to both prioritize and achieve measurable results. The operational and capital improvements we are driving will be especially important as we manage the business through the near term. While we expect to deliver sequential revenue growth through the rest of the year, the pace of the recovery will be slower than expected, which is reflected in our Q3 outlook. Specifically, Q3 will be impacted by a modest inventory digestion in CCG with DCAI and our more cyclical businesses of NEX, Altera, and Mobileye trending below our original forecast. Our outlook reflects industry-wide conditions without any meaningful change in our market share expectations. As we look into Q4, normal seasonal revenue growth has historically been in a range of flat to up 5% quarter-on-quarter. With improved client inventory levels exiting Q3, we see Q4 revenue at the high end of that range. Let me now provide more details by our key business units, starting with Intel Foundry. A key part of our strategy is returning to process leadership with our aggressive five-nodes-in-four-years march and the finish line is officially within sight. We are well into the ramp of Intel 4, Intel 3, and Intel 20A is been ready for production next quarter. On Intel 18A, we released the 1.0 PDK last month and are on track to be manufacturing-ready by the end of this year with production wafer start volumes in first half of 2025. Panther Lake for client is now running Windows and looking very healthy. This is the first microprocessor to use RibbonFet, PowerVia, and advanced packaging, achieving a significant milestone. Clearwater Forest for server, which also includes Foveros Direct and other key advanced packaging capabilities is booted and likewise looking very healthy. These are the first of many Intel 18A products on track to bring Intel 18A to the mass market. Importantly, the launch of 18A will be our fifth node in four years, completing an historic pace of design and process innovation and returning Intel to process leadership. Our team is resolute and determined to finish what we started and once we do, it will unlock further growth and value creation across our Foundry and Product businesses. Our investments in a global footprint of leading-edge capacity continues to weigh on near-term profitability, but long term, they position us to profitably participate in the largest and fastest-growing parts of the semiconductor market. We continue to expect the investments we're driving through this year to put us on a course for meaningful financial traction with operating profits for Intel Foundry troughing in 2024 and then driving to breakeven. To help accelerate [Technical Difficulty] our Foundry Services business, Kevin has led large foundry and fabless businesses outside Intel and is a great addition to our leadership team. He has hit the ground running [Technical Difficulty] considerable time with current and future Foundry customers as we ramp our process packaging and chipset capabilities for the AI era. We are also pleased to welcome Naga Chandrasekaran from Micron later this month to lead our Foundry Manufacturing and supply chain organization. He brings more than 20 years of leadership in deep technical R&D and manufacturing expertise that will help advance our priorities. Overall, our Foundry team is driving excellent collaboration with our design ecosystem partners. In Q2, Ansys, Cadence, Siemens, and Synopsys all announced the availability of reference flows for Intel's embedded multi-die interconnect bridge advanced packaging technology. EMIB makes it possible to cost-effectively scale to a larger silicon area by connecting multiple die in a single package, which simplifies the design process and offers design flexibility. These same partners also declared readiness for Intel 18A designs, and we will be collaborating closely with the ecosystem in the second half to prepare for next year's 18A launches. Beyond Intel 18A, we are well underway on Intel 14A and Intel 10A development. Even as we continue to extend leadership and innovation on our process roadmap, we are transitioning to a more normal cadence of node development. The normalized cadence will have positive implications for both pace and magnitude of ongoing R&D and capital spending requirements. Let's now turn to Intel Products. In our largest and most profitable business, CCG, we continue to strengthen our position and execute well against our roadmap. The AI PC category is transforming every aspect of the compute experience and Intel is at the forefront of this category creating moment. Intel Core Ultra volume more than doubled sequentially in Q2 and is already powering AI capabilities across more than 300 applications and 500 AI models. This is an ongoing testament to the strong ecosystem we have nurtured through 40 years of consistent investments. We have now shipped more than 15 million Windows AI PCs since our December launch, multiples more than all of our competitors combined, and we remain on track to ship more than 40 million AI PCs by year end, and over 100 million accumulative by the end of 2025. Lunar Lake, our next-generation AI PC, which achieved production release ahead of schedule in July, will be the next industry-wide catalyst for device refresh. Lunar Lake delivers superior performance at half the power with 50% better graphics performance and 40% more power efficiency versus the prior generation. Lunar Lake delivers 3 times more tops Gen-on-Gen with our enhanced NPU and will be the ultimate AI CPU on the shelf for the holiday cycle. Microsoft has qualified Lunar Lake to power more than 80 new Copilot+ PCs across more than 20 OEMs, which will begin to ship this quarter. Lunar Lake will quickly be joined by Arrow Lake, which will scale AI to the desktop category next quarter. And as mentioned earlier, we are already gearing up to launch Panther Lake next year to further extend our leadership position. So very good progress in CCG and a super strong roadmap over the next 18 months. Let me now turn to DCAI. This is one of the most important areas of focus as we work to improve our performance and market position. We have a strong foundation of which to build, including the more than 130 million Xeon powering data centers around the world today, and our roadmap is designed to build upon this vast installed base to deliver greater performance and efficiency, enable AI solutions that are open, flexible, and scalable and reduce total cost of ownership for customers. We took some important steps forward this quarter, starting with the launch of Xeon 6 with E-core processors, formerly codenamed Sierra Forest. This is our first Intel 3 product and is particularly well suited for high-density to scale our workloads. It drives performance up, power down, and dramatic rack consolidation. Early adopters are already seeing 25% better performance per watt versus competitive solutions. This will be followed by Xeon 6 with P-Core, codenamed Granite Rapids, which delivers greater performance for the most demanding workloads and will begin shipping this quarter. Looking to the future, we are excited about the launch of Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A server product featuring our industry-leading hybrid bonding. Clearwater Forest has achieved power-on and is on track to launch in 2025. As we've reestablished Xeon's competitive position, we are strongly positioned as the head node of choice in AI servers. We are also focused on improving our accelerator roadmap. We're delivering a combination of performance, flexibility, and value that is very compelling to customers, particularly cloud and enterprises seeking scalable, cost-effective Gen AI solutions. Our focus on open models, open developer frameworks, and reference designs combining Xeon with accelerators through OPEA or Open Platform for Enterprise AI, are gaining considerable market traction. Launching in Q3, Gaudi 3 will take our accelerator performance to the next level, at just two-thirds the cost of competitive offerings. To put it into perspective, we expect Gaudi 3 to deliver roughly 2 times performance per dollar in both inference and training versus H100. Gaudi 3 has strong ecosystem support, including Dell Technologies, Hewert-Packard Enterprise, Lenovo, Supermicro, Foxconn, Gigabyte, Inventec, Quanta Cloud Technology, and Wistron. Turning to NEX, we continue to see stability in Q2, while introducing new products that will expand our leadership in edge and networking into the future. As a founding member of the Ultra Ethernet Consortium, we announced an array of AI optimized scale-out Ethernet solutions, including the Intel AI Network Interface Card and Foundry Chiplets, which we'll launch next year. Our recent IPU adapter for the enterprise supported by Dell Technologies and Red Hat broadens access to the solution co-developed with Google Cloud. We expect the IPU to be accretive to growth and profitability as it becomes an increasingly important part of acceleration in the AI data center. We also announced the creation of Ultra Accelerator Link, a new industry standard dedicated to advancing high-speed, low latency communication for scale up AI systems, communication, and data centers. Combined with the growing number of use cases of AI on the edge, NEX is well-positioned to be an accretive growth driver in 2025 and beyond. Lastly, as Altera reaches full operational separation by year end, we are actively working toward capitalizing the business to generate proceeds for Intel on a path to an IPO in the coming years. We are excited to provide Altera with the mandate focus and resources to realize their growth opportunities and execute their strategy. We expect their increased autonomy will help to drive value for our shareholders, similar to the decisions we made with Mobileye two years ago and IMS last year. Before I turn to Dave, let me sum up by saying, it has been a hard fought first half of the year. We have achieved several important milestones and we are taking clear and decisive actions to improve our sustainable financial performance. We have entered Q3 with a very clear focus and renewed intensity to up our gain and are motivated by the progress we are seeing as we execute our strategy and realize our vision. That is the mindset driving us forward as we continue to build a stronger Intel. With that, I'll pass it over to Dave.
David Zinsner: Thank you, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. Second quarter revenue was $12.8 billion, down 1 point year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. Revenue was in line with the range we provided in May after receiving notice of an export license restriction, which negatively impacted our client business in China. Intel Products and Intel Foundry both delivered 4% year-over-year growth, offset by headwinds in our more cyclical businesses. Profitability was significantly more challenged versus our previous expectations with Q2 gross margin of 38.7% and EPS of $0.02. Weaker than expected gross margin was due to three main drivers. The largest impact was caused by an accelerated ramp of our AI PC product. In addition to exceeding expectations on Q2 Core Ultra shipments, we made the decision to accelerate transition of Intel 4 and Intel 3 wafers from our development fab in Oregon to our high-volume facility in Ireland, where wafer costs are higher in the near term. However, this change resulted in approximately $1 billion of capital savings and will improve Intel 4 and Intel 3 gross margin long-term as we scale up the Ireland fab. Margins were also impacted by higher than typical period charges related to non-core businesses and charges associated with unused capacity. Finally, we saw an unfavorable product mix and more competitive pricing than expected. Q2 operating cash flow was $2.3 billion, up approximately $3.5 billion sequentially on better working capital. Gross CapEx of $5.7 billion was more than offset by $11.5 billion in grants and partner contributions, highlighted by Apollo's SCIP investment in our Ireland factory operations, resulting in adjusted free cash flow of $8.2 billion. Intel Products revenue was $11.8 billion, up 4% year-over-year. The client business grew 9% year-over-year as the AI PC ramp contributed to higher volume and ASPs, partially offset by export license restrictions communicated during the quarter. DCAI revenue was roughly flat sequentially and down 3 points year-over-year. We expect sequential growth in the data center through the second half as demand for traditional servers improves modestly. Revenue for the NEX business was approximately flat both sequentially and year-over-year, so excluding the previously discussed inventory digestion impacting the telco market, NEX delivered 10% year-over-year growth in the first half. Q2 operating profit for Intel Products was $2.9 billion, 25% of revenue and up approximately $400 million year-over-year, on higher revenue and reduced inventory reserves. Intel Foundry delivered revenue of $4.3 billion, down 1 point sequentially and up 4% year-over-year, driven by increased wafer volume on Intel 7 and our first EUV nodes, Intel 4 and Intel 3. Foundry Services revenue more than doubled sequentially off a small base, including the start of advanced packaging revenue. Foundry operating loss of $2.8 billion was worse sequentially. We expect operating losses to continue at approximately the same rate in Q3 with more than 85% of wafer volumes still coming from pre-EUV nodes with an uncompetitive cost structure and power performance and area deficits reflected in market-based pricing. The continued ramp of our Intel 4 and Intel 3 Ireland facility and elevated R&D and start-up costs to support the rapid progression of our leading-edge technology development will also weigh on profitability. Mobileye revenue of $440 million improved 84% sequentially due to non-recurrence of the significant inventory drawdown that occurred in Q1. The rapid revenue and margin recovery indicates digestion occurred in an organized, predictable fashion, and we believe it is now complete. However, difficult conditions in China, which are impacting many Western automotive suppliers, led Mobileye to lower their revenue and income guidance for the second half. Altera delivered revenue of $361 million, up 6% sequentially with operating margins improving 4 points in the quarter. Revenue remains below consumption as inventory positions tied to previous supply constraints are worked down. We expect double-digit sequential revenue growth through the second half as customers return to more normal buying patterns. Now turning to our Q3 guidance. Weaker spending across consumer and enterprise markets, especially in China, and continued focus on AI server investments in the cloud have reduced our TAM expectations for 2024. As a result, customer inventory levels are elevated. We expect customers to reduce inventory over the second half of the year, along with the continued modest negative impact from export controls. These market dynamics should result in below seasonal revenue growth in Q3 with the client business flat to down and modest growth in data center and edge markets. With an expectation of healthier inventory positions exiting the quarter and the continuation of an enterprise refresh cycle, we should see revenue growth at the high end of seasonal in the fourth quarter. We expect gross margins to be moderately weaker sequentially with modest revenue growth and efficiencies offset by a continued ramp of new manufacturing nodes. While we will continue our work to improve near-term profitability, a heavier dependence on external wafers as we ramp AI PC products over the next several quarters will pressure gross margins. As a result of these factors, we expect revenue of $12.5 billion to $13.5 billion in the third quarter. At the midpoint of $13 billion, we expect gross margin of approximately 38% with a tax rate of 13% and EPS of negative $0.03, all on a non-GAAP basis. As Pat discussed earlier, lower than anticipated revenue in the back half of the year is putting pressure on gross margins and earnings. We are taking aggressive actions to significantly reduce spending in response. These actions, while difficult, will help streamline the organization to improve productivity and make better decisions more quickly. Please note that we are likely to have charges associated with these actions, some of which may be included in our non-GAAP results. Since we have not yet estimated these charges, they are not included in our guidance. Smart Capital continues to guide the pace and breadth of our global capacity expansion and our new operating model has uncovered opportunities to build and utilize manufacturing capacity more efficiently. Additionally, we've responded to lower revenue by reducing 2024 gross capital investments to a range of $25 billion to $27 billion with a net capital spending of $11 billion to $13 billion, including our SCIP programs. These adjustments ordinarily would bring us back to approximately breakeven adjusted free cash flow, but we now expect adjusted free cash flow to be modestly negative as we make payments related to the restructuring charges necessary to achieve our spending targets. In 2025, with OpEx of approximately $17.5 billion and net CapEx of $12 billion to $14 billion, we expect to achieve positive adjusted free cash flow. The suspension of the dividend, initial Altera capitalization, and positive adjusted free cash flow should significantly improve our liquidity in 2025 and position us to begin the process of meaningfully decreasing our leverage. Before I close, let me take a moment to highlight a couple of items as you model 2025. As previously mentioned, we expect operating expenses to be reduced from Street expectations of $21 billion to approximately $17.5 billion. We will also reduce spending within non-variable cost of sales by approximately $1 billion. While that will obviously have a positive impact on gross margins, we still only expect a roughly 60% fall-through for gross margin next year. The AI PC is a big winner for the company and the early signals on the performance of Lunar Lake are very positive. We therefore intend to ramp that product significantly next year to meet market demand. While the product is great, it was originally a narrowly targeted product using largely external wafers and not optimized for cost. As a result, our gross margins will likely be up only modestly next year. The good news is the follow-on product, Panther Lake, is internally sourced on 18A and has a much improved cost structure. As the momentum of AI PCs drives Panther Lake demand, together with the improvements from our new operating model and the cost savings from our lower capital spending, we will be in a great position to see meaningful gross margin expansion in subsequent years. Lastly, the non-controlled income from Mobileye, Altera, and IMF and the portion of the SCIPs earned by our partners show up on a line below net income called non-controlling interest. The NCI adjustment has been negligible so far, but we expect it to be a more meaningful driver, reducing our controlled share of income by approximately $700 million on a GAAP basis in 2025 and increasing as wafer production at our SCIP fabs in Arizona and Ireland increases in subsequent years. In closing, the market has not recovered as expected and we're obviously not satisfied with our results. We're responding by aggressively adjusting 2025 spending to achieve profitability and positive adjusted free cash flow that is commensurate with the current market conditions, while continuing to invest in and execute our strategy. In addition to these near-term actions, we're also seeing meaningful opportunities to improve financial results, leveraging our new operating model. We remain optimistic that reduced spending, operating efficiencies, and more competitive products will keep us on track to our target model of 60% gross margin and 40% operating margin by the end of the decade. I'll now turn it back over to John to start the Q&A.
John Pitzer: Thank you, Dave. We will now transition to the Q&A portion of our call. As a reminder, we would ask each of you to ask one question and a brief follow-up question where appropriate. With that, Jonathan, can we please take the first caller?
Operator: Certainly, our first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Your question, please.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Pat, big picture, are the challenges the product issue, market issue, strategic issue, execution issue, I'm just wondering has the core issues been accurately diagnosed, because when we look at your CPU competitor, they appear to be doing much better in this same environment. So I'm curious what is plan B if just cost cuts don't do the job?
Patrick Gelsinger: Yes. Thank you, Vivek. I'll start out, would say that this first phase of the recovery, restoration, and rebuilding plan is now well underway. With 18A, PDK 1.0, with Panther Lake, Clearwater Forest powered-on, our geo footprint now starting to take shape, we have more competitive products in every segment of the industry. That said, with that foundation in place, it's time for us to focus on Phase 2, building a more financially sustainable model for the company for the future. Many of the new products are yet to ramp into the marketplace and we're just now getting to competitiveness. But we need to build a more sustainable business model for us that allows us to have the financial wherewithal for the long-term journey. I'd say this rebuilding that we're underway, this is the most significant rebuilding of Intel since the transition from memory to microprocessors four decades ago. We firmly believe in the IDM 2.0 strategy. We're building two world-class companies. The forensics that we've done this year, this clean sheet exercise as we could describe it, is building a world-class Intel Foundry and building a world-class Intel Products Group. These efforts we believe have identified many opportunities for us to have financial savings. We've launched those aggressive steps today, and we believe that with the new products, a better financial position that we've done for a more efficient operation that we see the long-term opportunity for significant value creation for all of our stakeholders.
John Pitzer: Vivek, do you have a follow-up?
Vivek Arya: Yes. Thank you, John. For my follow-up, I'm curious, what impact do the restrictions -- sorry, the restructuring actions have on either your R&D roadmap, your long-term external foundry opportunity, and any CHIPS Act funding? I think in the past you had suggested about $15 billion in long-term value from external foundry, is there any impact on those growth targets because of the restructuring action? Just what changes with these restructuring actions? Thank you.
Patrick Gelsinger: Yes, thank you, Vivek. And fundamentally, we believe our strategy will be maintained even as we get these more efficient steps in place. The CHIPS grants -- taking your questions sort of one-by-one, on the CHIP side, these are milestone-based investments. We still believe that we're comfortably able to execute against those milestones across the projects that we've announced. So we believe very comfortably that the CHIPS model that we've put in place, we've worked closely with the CHIPS program office in the U.S. government, we're very comfortable on those plans. Also, the foundry, we are seeing a lot of momentum in areas like the advanced packaging areas where we're actually seeing quite a lot of uptake and expansion of those opportunities. So the $15 billion of LDV that we've talked about and the $15 billion revenue by the end of the decade, we're very confident that those are still very solid guidelines for us to be building to. Obviously, with the capital changes that we've made, we're going to be driving just like a world-class foundry does to be much more efficient with our capital investments and scrutinizing them more carefully. And now that we've paid the capital to catch up, and I'll view -- this catch-up capital, we had no spare capacity, we had no site ahead, show ahead. We had no capacity to catch up. As those investments are now largely completed, we're able to focus much more on capital efficiency for the future and aligning our capital spend to the market signals as we see to the future of our products as well as the foundry commitments that we have in place. Finally, I'll just say, again, we're building this against the market outlook. We're going to flex our investments up and down appropriately, and we've now established a model with our smart capital to have that effectiveness that we can scale up and down to market conditions. So we feel like all of the things that we said for our strategy on track and we're now moving into Phase 2 of the execution of that strategy.
John Pitzer: Thanks, Vivek. Jonathan, can we have the next caller, please?
Operator: Certainly. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.
Ross Seymore: Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Kind of want to follow-up on the first two, and Pat, maybe just ask it a different way. Part of what you're saying, it sounds like you're adjusting your spending across the board to reflect the macro reality, slower growth, et cetera, et cetera, but it seems like that would be difficult to do if it didn't impact any of the structural dynamics as well. So I guess the real question is, are there any changes either to your competitiveness, the structure of the company, the long-term $100 billion target that you just saw weren't happening and therefore felt these cuts were necessary, so do any of the structural changes -- or can you describe any of the structural changes and what the outcome to your financial targets might be?
Patrick Gelsinger: Yes, let me point you back to what I said at the start. We started this forensics, this clean sheet analysis concurrent with the rolling out of our new operational model. We said we have to be a world-class foundry. We are going to benchmark ourselves against world-class foundries and that's what Intel Foundry is going to become, and that's uncovered a lot of things, a lot of inefficiencies, a lot of ways that we can drive our capital footprint more effectively, and every aspect of that business is being analyzed and how we do maintenance, how we procure chemicals, how we run and price wafers and shuttle lots and everything like that so clean sheet analysis. Similarly, on the product side, we've done exactly that same analysis. What does a world-class fabulous company look like. And we uncover quite a lot of areas where we don't leverage industry IPs. We're not using our EDA vendors as effectively. We've done too many steppings. We validate versus build-in design quality. So many of these things are steps that we're taking to be a world-class Fabless company, and these are significant structural steps. We also realized that as an IDM 1.0, we were never built for efficiency. We were built for leadership. And now as we add this focus on efficiency, we see a lot of opportunities. I'm having each of the four business areas, client, networking, and data center, look at their own portfolios, even though those are the right product areas for us for the future, and similarly, the portfolio of our Intel Foundry business and that's the work that we've now been undertaking and we're now accelerating based on the less than expected quarterly results, we're accelerating those impacts. We're going to drive that in the second half of this year. We want to get these restructurings done quickly so that we can move forward more aggressively with the product lines next year. In terms of the long-term forecast, we're clearly tempering our view of how fast we can grow in the near-term based on the market conditions. But our model is built that we will scale up or scale down the capital requirements appropriate to the market conditions we see. We believe the long-term guidance that we've given you, the 60:40, getting to the Foundry business model we've described, the growth areas that we've said, those are larger portions of our business. We believe those are long-term still achievable in that regard and we're on track for many of those things in the models that we're laying out and today's actions will help accelerate us achieving those.
John Pitzer: Ross, do you have a quick follow-up?
Ross Seymore: Yes, I do. Dave, you went through with the good details of the cost structure and what would change the puts and takes for next year. I wondered -- I know you're not going to guide to 2025 revenue, but the puts and takes from maybe a competitive positioning point-of-view, how you're feeling in CCG, DCAI, primarily relative to the competition, any sort of tailwind, headwind analysis or description for 2025 would be helpful.
David Zinsner: Yes, sure. On the client side, obviously, we feel very good given our AI PC position, we're leading that new product category. And I think we talked a little bit in the prepared remarks about Lunar Lake, our next product coming in after Meteor Lake and the performance of that, so that looks like a phenomenally good product and position. We're making the early inroads on the AI side of data center and that's only going to grow as we go into next year. The big question is when does the kind of traditional CPU market recover? It has been tempered this year, and of course, affected by other regions of the world like China spending and so forth. That's obviously been a soft space and so we'll have to see how that plays out. And then NEX, obviously also outside of the telco space is starting to recover. And then we have these other businesses, Altera is starting to recover now. So we're optimistic that next year will be a good year for them and we'll have to see how Mobileye plays out ultimately. I think on the margin front, I talked about our kind of tempered view of gross margins next year, given the ramp of Lunar Lake, which with memory and package and almost all of the material getting sourced outside and they're seeing -- we're seeing inflation in that space that is impacting it. But that part is followed by Panther Lake, that comes back into the fab. And I think one of the bigger stories we'll have once we get beyond next year is kind of the resurgence of our internal facilities to start taking on a lot of the capacity that we had to move into the external sources should provide some meaningful improvement in terms of -- in terms of profitability. And then, of course, we've done a lot, as Pat talked about in terms of restructuring the business and those will start to show up next year, but will be even more impactful the following year, including the new operating model. So I think the good news for us is we actually don't need a ton of growth to see our model play out, both in the kind of medium term and long term in terms of gross margins and operating margins. And if we do get the growth, it puts us in an even better position.
John Pitzer: Thank you, Ross. Jonathan, can we have the next caller, please?
Operator: Certainly. And our next question comes from the line of CJ Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your question, please.
CJ Muse: Yes. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, Dave, a follow-up to that prior question. I was hoping you could perhaps speak to how to think about gross margins beyond 2025. It's obviously very hard to offer the leverage when you're investing in both foundry capacity and at the same time outsourcing meaningful tiles to TSM. So encouraging that you're bringing Panther Lake back in-house. How should we think about incremental margins there? And any of the other kind of moving parts that you've been speaking about on this call, including the unfavorable product mix and the more competitive pricing. Is that just a near-term kind of phenomenon or something else we should be thinking about into 2025, 2026?
David Zinsner: Yes. So as I talked about to Ross, CJ, the good news for 2026 for us is that, that really begins the shift back to the internal manufacturing footprint for a lot of our tiles and so bringing back more wafers to the internal network will meaningfully improve the cost structure. I think the adjustments in CapEx, which are clearly helpful in terms of cash flow in the near term become really beneficial to the cost structure as depreciation becomes kind of less of a headwind for us, so that will also be helpful. And then like I said, we've got all these structural improvements that are coming our way, both from the actions we've taken today, but the new operating model and decisions will get made on a go-forward basis that will just optimize our business model going forward. I think 2026 should be a good year for us in terms of gross margins. We'll save the actual number for a later date when we have more visibility into how things are playing out. I think from a mix perspective, it's probably not going to be a big headwind or tailwind for us, just strict mix other than as we move towards more leading-edge wafers, the margins on those wafers are significantly better than the margins in pre-EUV nodes. So that will -- that will be one factor that will certainly help us. It also -- in that regard, that also helps us on the pricing side because, obviously, from a wafer perspective, we get better pricing on EUV wafers as opposed to pre-EUV wafers. And then ultimately, I think on pricing, it will really come down to when we have a competitive process and we have competitive products running on a competitive process and we're delivering what the customers want, that helps us in terms of the pricing dynamic. And we're getting to the place as Pat talked about where we're starting to deliver on all those fronts. And so I feel good about our opportunity to realize that in the form of pricing as we progress through the next few years.
Patrick Gelsinger: And just one thing to add on top of that, just to clarify, with Panther Lake already powered on, right, and showing good health, that is a product that we start ramping in the second half of next year, right? So we'll start to see some of those benefits, but obviously, the huge volume benefits of that really are in 2026, where we'll be very aggressive at bringing both the wafers home on a more competitive process with a more competitive product with Panther Lake, offsetting the volumes of Lunar Lake, which is almost entirely outsourced. So we bring Tiles home with a more competitive product and a more competitive process, and that really is, I'll say, the story that will start to unfold as we talk to you more next year.
John Pitzer: CJ, do you have a quick follow-up?
CJ Muse: Yes. Just a quick one on OpEx. You gave us the $17.5 billion for all of calendar 2025, but could you share with us what you think the exit rate would look like? I'm coming to around $4.25 billion, is that in the ballpark?
David Zinsner: Yes. I'll say, given that some of the actions we're taking will kind of go through at least the early part of next year, we're going to enter at a higher number than we're going to exit, I'll give you that. And we should be down in 2026 relative to 2025. Give me some time as we progress through the year to start to fine-tune the budget for 2026 and I'll give you more clarity around that.
John Pitzer: Thank you, C.J. And Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?
Operator: Certainly. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.
Joseph Moore: Great. Thank you. You talked about the server roadmap with Sierra Forest shipping and Granite Rapids shipping this quarter, can you talk about how that -- where that puts you competitively? Do you think you're kind of have closed the gap or is it leadership product, and obviously, Clearwater for us is the longer-term focus, but where are we in the interim?
Patrick Gelsinger: Yes, thank you. And obviously, Sierra Forest, right, E-core product, very efficient, but a new category for us, so we have to go win sockets with it. Early customer feedback, very positive. As we said, greater than 25% TCO value that they're seeing from it, but it's early in its ramp. Granite Rapids is really the peak core, I'll say, the more traditional Xeon for us and we'll start that ramp this quarter. But we'll take as anything in the server market, winning back share, winning back sockets is a longer-term cycle for that. But a lot of encouraging signs for Granite Rapids, even though a lot of the data center energy right now is on the AI build-out, as you know. So in this environment, we're largely facing a period where much of the investment energy is going into the AI footprint. So we're having to fight to win those socket back, but Granite Rapids looks very positive. The early health of Clearwater Forest is really spectacular. This is a really stunning technical achievement with the new design, 8A, this level of health, this are early in a major server product is really spectacular. The new Foveros Direct and should have substantial TCO benefits for next year. And then the next P-Core version of that on 18A is also showing very good -- not in fab yet, but showing a very good design progress. So we feel like the roadmap gets more competitive, and with it, we believe our market share position is fairly, I'll say, static, right? So year-on-year, we do see that overall the arm market share is more modest in the second half this year, so the X86 share, and we're stabilizing our overall position in the marketplace. We believe as we then go to fight to win back. One of the good things that we've seen for our server market is the AI head nodes where we're quite advantaged and we're seeing a lot of interest in Xeon being the head node of choice for anybody's accelerator, including ours. So a lot of things to unpack there, but we do feel like our position is stabilizing and strengthening with our products and the roadmap only improves from here.
John Pitzer: Joe, do you have a follow-up?
Joseph Moore: Yes. Just on the notion that AI has kind of stolen some of the focus from server, it seems like we would be looking at a ceiling in overall power budgets in a couple of years that would mean we need to invest in traditional server ecosystems and maybe do a significant refresh. Do you see any indications of that and given that -- I perceive you guys are sort of stronger in enterprise than in cloud right now, like how are you positioned to take advantage of that when it does come?
Patrick Gelsinger: Yes. Thanks, Joe. And we do think that the enterprise market, right, is a more favorable market for us and we do have some early indications of a positive cycle there, but I'll say it's too early to give you any real firm indications, but we are starting to see, I'll say, better buying behavior, better signals from our OEMs in the enterprise market. Similarly, for the cloud market, we do believe there will be a refresh cycle, right, as people get their AI strategies in place. The TCO benefits of a server refresh now as we start talking about 3X, 4X consolidation ratios that they can have on their traditional, right, cloud environments, their container delivery environments, these are quite substantial. So we do believe that as our products get to be more competitive, right, and there is a natural refresh cycle on that, that the markets will be more favorable for the traditional CPU market. But of course, the story is CPU plus GPU, right, and that's the bigger message that we'll be delivering. And obviously, as Gaudi 3 starts shipping the CPU plus GPU use cases like we've described with OPEA, that will also help us for positioning on both sides of the cloud and the enterprise market for both CPU and GPU. That's the strategy that we're building toward.
John Pitzer: Thank you, Joe. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?
Operator: Certainly. And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question, please.
Timothy Arcuri: Sure, thanks. Dave, can you again explain how June gross margin was so much worse than you thought just three months ago? I mean, revenue is basically in line. I know you talked about mix, but it seems like it was probably a pretty small part of it mix was and it was really more the decisions around Intel 4 and Intel 3. So can you just explain again, I'm not sure -- I'm not sure I understand why that was such a big.
David Zinsner: Yes. Okay. That was the biggest one. Let me -- I'll just say that there were a couple of other things that we had to do some write-offs related to legacy businesses that impacted us. Our utilization was a bit lower that did impact us. But the biggest one was the shift. We were originally planning to ramp Meteor Lake, Intel 3, and even run production on Intel 4 -- sorry, Intel 4, and then run production on Intel 3 in Oregon, which is our TD fab, our process technology fab, kind of our development fab. We made the decision to more quickly shift all of that over to Ireland. And it's a good move because it saves capital. We don't have to spend capital twice essentially. And it starts to mature the Intel 4 and Intel 3 processes in Ireland more quickly. The downside of that is the wafers are expensive right now. And so we get this kind of early ramp of the product at a much higher wafer cost that we're pushing through the system and that puts pressure on the margins. That's going to carry into next quarter. I mean, we will do better in next quarter, obviously, but we're going to do more volume and the margins will be below the corporate average because of -- because while we're improving the wafer cost, it's not -- still not to the point where it's above corporate average yet. And so it will weigh down on margins for the third quarter as well. After that, we start -- it gets more and more mature, the cost structure gets better and the situation on Meteor Lake will improve meaningfully.
John Pitzer: Tim, do you have a quick follow-up?
Timothy Arcuri: Yes. Pat, can you just talk about the foundry strategy given the CapEx cut? I guess my question is how you sort of execute on the plan with this lower CapEx. I mean kind of on one hand, you keep -- we keep talking about bringing all these wafers back in-house to help gross margin in 2026. But I also hear about a lot more outsourcing to TSMC even in real-time so, is the cut more that some of your foundry customers are maybe structurally deciding that they're not as committed? I'm just trying to understand how you can kind of CapEx and still execute on this strategy. Thanks.
Patrick Gelsinger: Yes, thank you. And at the highest level, the Foundry strategy unchanged. And we've built capacity corridor for Foundry customers. However, until we have committed orders, we're going to be modest on how much equipment we put against the shells and the sites that we have in place. And how much of that corridor we keep available, how much flexibility working with our equipment suppliers that we need for that will be a subject of careful scrutiny as we go forward. We've also made some adjustments in the capital investment that we need to support our current view of market forecast. So all of those are, say, are adjustments. The big thing is now that we're finishing this phase of aggressive build-out, right, and as you think about what we had to catch up, we had no EUV capacity. We had no shell ahead, side ahead capacity. We had no capacity to pull tiles home. As those come into place, we've been making substantial capital investments over the last couple of years, and now we're focused on how do we harvest those investments in 2024, 2025, and 2026. So we're putting much more aggressive view of capital utilization, right? How much capital require ahead of working with the suppliers to be more efficient in our capital dollars, just like a foundry does? And for that, we'll point you back to again, right, we're going to be a world-class fabless company. Intel Products, we're going to be a world-class Foundry with Intel Foundry. The last point I'd make here on this is a lot of the early success that we're having with foundry customers is advanced packaging. And there, the capital requirements are not as significant as required for wafer capacity. So we believe very much that we're seeing a surge of interest there. Customers in advanced packaging are clearly interested in us for capacity, but increasingly for our most advanced packaging technology. So that's an area that we believe we have as, and we've described before, as the on-ramp for Intel Foundry and that's continuing to look very good. The final point is the Intel Foundry capacity will be aligned with, right, to the first order, the Intel product requirements. And clearly, there's a lot of tiles externally in 2025, we bring those home in 2026, that's when we'll start to really, as Dave said, see the benefits of the model that we've put in place. Tiles coming home, leadership process technology, leadership products starts in 2025, deliver big-time in 2026 and beyond.
John Pitzer: Thanks, Tim. Jonathan, do we have the next caller, please?
Operator: Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from Raymond James. Your question, please.
Srini Pajjuri: Thank you. A couple of follow-ups. Dave, on the move from Oregon to Ireland fab, you talked about that being a gross margin headwind. Can you talk about how much -- can you clarify how much of a headwind that is right now? And also when it's fully-loaded on a like-for-like basis, how much of a headwind do you think that's going to be on an ongoing basis?
David Zinsner: I'm sorry, the second question is how much will the headwind be on...
John Pitzer: On ongoing basis.
David Zinsner: On an ongoing basis is what you're saying?
Srini Pajjuri: Ongoing basis? Yeah.
David Zinsner: Okay. All right. So I think the best way to think about it is, we were -- I don't know, 400 basis points or so off on the gross margin taking into account revenue was part of it. It was a meaningful chunk of that 400 basis points. There was the write-offs related to legacy businesses and the mix and underutilization also affected and it wasn't an insignificant amount, but that was a good portion of that 400 basis points, let's call it that. And that will be the case in the third quarter probably given the increase. I think we're talking about a 50% increase in Meteor Lake quarter-over-quarter in the third quarter. Beyond that, it's going to start to become less and less to the point where it's actually not going to be a headwind.
Patrick Gelsinger: Yes, it becomes a tailwind.
David Zinsner: Yes, exactly.
Patrick Gelsinger: As the Ireland factory ramps, a production factory will have a lower-cost per wafer start than a TV factory like Oregon. So it becomes a headwind as we go into next year.
David Zinsner: Tailwind as we go into... Now as we -- now the challenge for next year will be, we'll now be ramping Lunar Lake next year. Lunar Lake has the memory in the package, so we're going to have to essentially buy that at a price and turn around and include that in our price at 0% margin. So that puts some negative pressure on the margins. And additionally, it's got more of the content sourced externally, and as you know, we're seeing some inflation. So that one then becomes more of the -- Meteor Lake starts to be helpful, but Lunar Lake starts to become a drag on the Intel Products margins, which is why we're tempered in terms of our outlook for margins next year because we're going to have a lot of improvements on the Intel Foundry side. It's going to be tempered on the product side and it's really going to be because of Lunar Lake.
Patrick Gelsinger: And I was just going to add one thing, as we move the Intel 4, Intel 3 capacity into Ireland, it also gives our TD team more focus on their capital on 18A as well as then 14A and 10A, and we're taking, for instance, the second high NA tool is coming into our Oregon facility. So we're well underway on 14A. So part of this was a capacity and cost decision for the long term. Part of it was an AI PC acceleration, but it was also a TD cadence decision and optimizing the use of our TD resources for the next-generation technologies, which are already well underway and showing good early indicators.
John Pitzer: Srini, do you have a quick follow-on?
Srini Pajjuri: Yes. So, Pat, I think in the past, you talked about the foundry business potentially breaking even sometime 2027, and given all the cuts -- and you seem to at least sound confident that foundry opportunity is not changing, so I'm just curious, do you see a possibility that Foundry business could actually breakeven sooner given all the cuts?
Patrick Gelsinger: Clearly, that's our objective for Dave and I. You all say that said, we have a lot of wood to chop until we complete that journey. The steps that we've taken today are significant, right, ones for our operational efficiency that we're putting in place. So clearly that's our operating objective that we have. But as we said, 2026 is really this year that many of these wafers come home, many of the new factory investments come online, the new process technologies. So I'd say that 2027 timeframe is still a good one, but you can trust that every aspect of what we're doing is to accelerate the profitability. And the significant announcement today of the cost and financial focus, right, will give us, I'll say, the scrutiny and the lens by which to focus our Intel Foundry, $10 billion next year is a big number and we expect that many of these operational improvements will carry-forward in 2026. Dave said, an acceleration of our adjusted free cash flow turning positive, so everything that we're doing is aligned with our thought, Srini.
John Pitzer: Thank you, Srini. Jonathan, we've got time for one more question.
Operator: Certainly. Then our final question for today comes from the line of Matt Ramsay from TD Cowen. Your question, please.
Matthew Ramsay: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you, guys. I guess my first question is on the client space. I think, Dave, you might have mentioned client flat to down in September. I think your primary x86 competitor is going to be up double-digits or I think they mentioned above seasonal, however, you quantify seasonal now. Maybe you could give us a little color there. There's lots of maybe noise in the system about ARM coming into the client market, I think that impact would be more modest relative to what you described. But if you could kind of give us puts and takes there and how the inventory with OEMs might be affecting what you're guiding for since September. Thanks.
Patrick Gelsinger: Yes. I'll take that Matt. We feel very good with our client position, the momentum we have in AI PC. Here we have a very healthy ecosystem as well. And I'll say as the large market share position that we have, we're very focused on sell-in and sell-through in the channel. So I believe our overall view of inventory levels, where our market share is, we're actually quite comfortable in the indications that we've given some inventory sell-through in the third quarter above seasonal in Q4. Overall, the TAM expansion is low-single-digit, even though we're seeing a lot of enthusiasm around the AI PC and further TAM expansion as we go into 2025 as expected now broadly. We'd also say that our position in the commercial portion of this market is very strong with our vPro assets and we believe we're coming into a refresh cycle on the corporate. We also saw things like vPro have great success for customers as they were dealing with the CrowdStrike Blue Screen period and customers who are vPro customers were able to recover in a day or so, where customers not on vPro took weeks to recover from that. So a lot of reinforcement of the ecosystem, the leadership that we have on AI PC. And as Dave said, Lunar Lake and Panther Lake only make our market position stronger. So I think we're very comfortable and every indication so far this quarter is very solid for those outcomes.
John Pitzer: Matt, do you have a quick follow-on?
Matthew Ramsay: Yes, I do. Thanks, John. I wanted to ask -- I think in some of the prepared script and maybe early in the Q&A, Pat, you kind of reiterated the $15 billion funnel for the Foundry business, and I know in the medium term, a lot of that is packaging, but I wanted to ask about the customers that you've engaged with on 18A and maybe early on 14A, how have you seen the charts of the programs that they're planning to bring into your foundry progress in the last few quarters. Are people still committed to ramping those things? Are they taking PDKs and maybe doing tape-ins? Are things moving forward? Have you seen any acceleration? Have you seen hesitation or maybe wait-and-see from those customers? I'm just trying to figure out how that stuff is progressing on 18A? Thanks.
Patrick Gelsinger: Yes. Let me just clarify, the $15 billion is lifetime deal value of committed deals, right? So this isn't a pipeline. This is committed business that we now have in place. So I just want to clarify that, Matt, because I think your question suggests that the pipeline. There's a lot more in the pipeline. This is $15 billion of committed deals. As you say, a lot of the near-term opportunity has been advanced packaging and we're seeing a significant expansion of that capability in terms of volume and technology. On 18A specifically, a lot of customers have been waiting for the PDK, right, and now that we released the PDK last month, the 1.0 PDK, we've seen a flurry of activity with the EDA, the IP vendors, and the end customers. So I'd be optimistic that we have good indicators coming in that area in the future, but this was really the starting point for many of them to go from test chips to start looking at production chips coming based on the PDK that we've just released. So we remain very comfortable with our earlier comments in that area. I'd say, we do believe that we'll have further updates there, but as we've also indicated, customers are reluctant to put their name out there given the supply base and the traditional operation of the Foundry industry. Overall, things are looking on track for what we've said with a meaningful acceleration in packaging over the last quarter, more updates to come. Maybe with that, John, I'll wrap us up. Thank you for joining our call. We appreciate the time as always. And I'd say on a couple of these topics, I hope to see many of you at the Deutsche Bank Technology Conference coming up where we'll have some further updates. I want to reiterate in a quarter like this that we are resolved to finish the audacious turnaround, the building of our process and product key milestones that we've achieved of this phase, but now we have to shift to putting more emphasis on the financial sustainability of our business. We're making difficult decisions as we rightsize. We rebuild a more efficient, leaner, agile Intel for the future and one that we're confident will enable our long-term success. Thanks, and good afternoon, everybody.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",2024-08-01
INTC,2024,3,2024-Q3-INTC,"Operator: Thank you for standing by and welcome to Intel Corporation's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. John Pitzer, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
John Pitzer: Thank you, Jonathan. By now you should have received a copy of the Q3 earnings release and earnings presentation, both of which are available on our Investor Relations website, intc.com. For those joining us online today, the earnings presentation is also available in our webcast window. I am joined today by our CEO, Pat Gelsinger; and our CFO, David Zinsner. In a moment, we will hear brief comments from both followed by a Q&A session. Before we begin, please note that today's discussion does contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such are subject to various risks and uncertainties. It also contains reference to non-GAAP and segment financial measures that we believe provide useful information to our investors. Our earnings release, most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC provide more information on specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. They also provide additional information on our non-GAAP and segment financial measures, including reconciliations where appropriate to our corresponding GAAP financial measures. With that let me turn things over to Pat.
Patrick Gelsinger: Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. I appreciate you joining us today. We delivered Q3 revenue above the midpoint of our guidance and we made significant progress on our cost reduction plan. That said, Q3 profitability was negatively impacted by the charges we referenced on our Q2 call. This reflects the aggressive actions we are taking to lower our cost, improve our efficiency, and enhance our market competitiveness. Dave will go into these charges in detail shortly. Operationally, Q3 results exceeded our expectations as we achieved key milestones across Intel Foundry and Intel Products. Underlying trends in the business are improving at a measured pace, and our outlook for Q4 is modestly above current consensus. Overall, our stepped up focus on efficiency and execution across business is having a positive impact. We have a lot more ahead and we are acting with urgency to deliver on our priorities. We need to fight for every inch and execute better than ever before and our teams are embracing this mindset as we build a leaner, more profitable Intel. Now, let me provide more details starting with an update on our cost reduction plan that we announced three months ago. First, we completed the vast majority of our headcount actions during Q3 and we are on track to our greater than 15% workforce reduction before the end of the year. These were hard but necessary changes that are reducing complexity and making us a leaner, faster and more agile company. Second, we have reduced our capital expenditures by over 20% relative to the plan we had entering the year. We are now well positioned with our shell ahead strategy to react quickly to market demand. With our transition to EUV now complete and the launch of Intel 18A on the horizon, we have a more normal cadence of node development at Intel 14A and beyond. In addition, our teams are maniacally focused on improving fab productivity, allowing us to produce more with less over time. Third, we have begun to simplify and streamline parts of our portfolio to unlock efficiencies and create value. We are re-establishing product portfolio leadership by narrowing our focus on fewer projects with the top priority being to maximize the value of our x86 franchise across the client, edge and data center markets. As part of our portfolio simplification, we will move our Edge business into CCG and refocus our NEX portfolio on networking and telco. We will also integrate our software business into our core business units to foster more integrated solutions that address our customers' most difficult challenges. We are evaluating other portfolio actions which we will communicate when appropriate and we plan to provide new segment reporting that reflects these portfolio shifts in Q1 of 2025. Related to our cost and efficiency actions, the restructuring charges we took in Q3 were significant and necessary to right-size the company as we reduced spending by over $10 billion in 2025. There was also a sizable impairment mostly related to Intel 7 equipment and space reflecting excess COVID era spending that we have concluded cannot migrate to more advanced nodes now that we have fully transitioned to EUV processing. From a broader financial perspective, the actions we took in Q3 go a long way towards delivering the 2025 financial commitments we outlined last quarter. Specifically, we plan to reduce non-product cost of sales by $1 billion lower OpEx to $17.5 billion and drive gross and net CapEx to between $20 billion to $23 billion and $12 billion to $14 billion respectively. We expect adjusted free cash flow to be positive next year and we will focus on decreasing leverage and improving liquidity. Let me go into greater detail on the business starting with Intel Products. We continue to focus on our core x86 franchise and the ecosystems we have developed over 40 plus years of investing. They are a tangible source of value and differentiation for Intel, our partners and our collective customers, and help to cement the x86 architecture as uniquely positioned to meet customer demands going forward. We are taking steps to supercharge and further unlock the value of our x86 franchise. We intend to drive new levels of customization, compatibility and scalability needed to meet current and future demands of next-generation computing and we see this unlocking a range of meaningful opportunities across all our businesses. I am particularly excited about our recent announcement with AMD to create the x86 Ecosystem Advisory Group. We are bringing together leaders from across the ecosystem to help shape the future of x86 with a focus on simplifying software development, ensuring interoperability and interface consistency across vendors and equipment developers with standardized architectural tools and guidelines. Broadcom, Dell, Google, HPE, HP Inc., Lenovo, Meta, Microsoft, Oracle, Red Hat have signed on as founding members as have industry luminaries, Linus Torvalds and Tim Sweeney. Turning to our product segments, in CCG, we continue to lead the AI PC category. In September at IFA, we launched our Intel Core Ultra 200V series processors formerly named Lunar Lake. This is the most efficient family of x86 processors ever created, setting a new standard for mobile AI performance and significantly out performing competitor platforms. Lunar Lake's combination of superior performance at comparable and competitive battery life positions us well to continue to define and lead the AI PC category. We also continue to nurture the most robust AI PC ecosystem in the industry with more than 100 ISVs, 300 applications and 500 AI models powered by Core Ultra and we remain on track to ship more than a 100 million AI PCs accumulative by the end of 2025. Next up is Arrow Lake, which launched earlier this month and brings the power of the AI PC to the desktop, delivering a huge leap in performance per watt and bringing an NPU to enthusiast desktop and entry workstation platforms for the first time. All of this is paving the way toward the launch of Panther Lake in the second half of 2025. Panther Lake will be our first client CPU on Intel 18A, a more performant and cost competitive process that will allow us to bring more wafers home and improve overall profitability. Overall, we are making good progress in CCG. Our share position is strong with a product roadmap and ecosystem that is increasingly setting us apart from our competition, especially in the enterprise market as customers continue to see increasing value from our vPro solutions. Turning to DCAI, our focus is squarely on delivering powerful AI systems that provide enterprise customers with greater choice and flexibility, optimal performance per watt, and lower total cost of ownership and this quarter's launches significantly enhance our market competitiveness even as we recognize we have more work to do. We launched our latest Xeon 6 product code-named Granite Rapids, which doubles the performance of the prior gen with increased core counts, memory bandwidth and embedded AI acceleration. The new Xeon 6 is tailor-made to handle compute intensive workloads with exceptional efficiency from edge to data center and cloud environments. This solidifies our position as the head node of choice in AI servers. Greater than 70% of [Technical Difficulty] servers are already using Intel Xeon as the host CPU and we have a significant opportunity to build on this as we continue re-establishing Xeon's competitive strength and market leadership. This quarter, we also launched our Gaudi 3 AI accelerator, which delivers twice the networking bandwidth and 1.5x the memory bandwidth of its predecessor for large language model efficiency. While the Gaudi 3 benchmarks have been impressive and we are pleased by our recent collaboration with IBM to deploy Gaudi 3 as a service on IBM Cloud. The overall uptake of Gaudi has been slower than we anticipated as adoption rates were impacted by the product transition from Gaudi 2 to Gaudi 3 and software ease of use. As a result, we will not achieve our target of 500 million in revenue for Gaudi in 2024. That said, taking a longer term view, we remain encouraged by the market available to us. There is clear need for solutions with superior TCO based on open standards and we are continuing to enhance the Gaudi value proposition. In NEX, we announced last month that we will be focusing the business on networking and telco as part of our efforts to simplify our portfolio, drive productivity, and enhance our market position. We will move our Edge business into CCG, which creates a meaningful opportunity to more efficiently leverage our core client business and extend our leadership to a wide range of vertical edge solutions, especially as AI on the edge accelerates. As a simpler, more focused NEX, we are better positioned to gain profitable share in the most attractive markets. In Networking, we continue to further Open Source Ethernet solutions for connectivity through our Ultra Accelerator Link and Ultra Ethernet Consortium. Let me now turn to Intel Foundry. A key part of our strategy is returning to process leadership through disciplined execution of our roadmap. Intel 18A, our fifth node in four years is healthy and continues to progress well at this stage in the development process. Our lead vehicles for Intel 18A, Panther Lake, and Clearwater Forest have met early 18A milestones ahead of next year's launches. In addition, we have seen good traction with the release of our 1.0 PDK last quarter and the material increase in the engagements and the number of RFQs we are actively quoting. While we will not win them all, we are confident in our head-to-head position based on feedback from potential customers. Most recently, as announced, we are finalizing a multiyear, multibillion dollar commitment by AWS to expand our existing partnership to include a new custom Xeon 6 chip on Intel 3 and the new AI fabric chip on Intel 18A. Beyond AWS, we added two additional 18A wafer design wins this quarter from compute centric companies and our pipeline of potential wafer designs has grown nicely over the quarter. Given our leadership and advanced packaging capabilities, we also added multiple backend design wins this quarter. We were also awarded an additional 3 billion in direct funding under the Secure Enclave program to produce leading-edge semiconductors for the US government. We are proud to be the US government's Partner of Choice to fortify the domestic semiconductor supply chain and ensure the US maintains its leadership in advanced manufacturing microelectronic systems and process technology. Moving forward, as we shared last month, we are creating clearer separation for Intel Foundry by establishing the business as an independent subsidiary. This is important to our external foundry customers and will give us future flexibility to evaluate independent sources of funding and optimize the capital structure of Intel Foundry and Intel Products. We are in the process of forming a fiduciary board for the new foundry subsidiary, which will include independent directors with deep semiconductor experience. In our all other category, our number one priority is to unlock shareholder value. For Altera, revenue increased 14% sequentially and operating profit turned positive in Q3. We also announced the introduction of our new mid-range and small form factor products, Agilex 5 and Agilex 3 to serve broad market customers and segments. With an increasingly competitive roadmap, the business is well-positioned to show continued top and bottom line improvements. Consistent with what we have said previously, we remain focused on selling a stake in Altera on a path to its IPO in the coming years. To that end, we have begun discussions with potential investors and expect to conclude in early 2025. For Mobileye, the company continues to be a leader in the development and deployment of advanced driver assistance systems and by providing Mobileye with separation and autonomy, we have enhanced its ability to capitalize on growth opportunities and accelerate its path to creating even greater value. The company recently hosted an AI event laying out a comprehensive strategy for camera-centric compound AI systems providing a full range of autonomous driving solutions. Wrapping up, our Q3 results reflect heightened focus, discipline and execution you can expect moving forward. We are rigorously managing our costs and improving our profitability to create long-term shareholder value. We are carefully managing our cash to strengthen our balance sheet and improve our liquidity and we are staying closely connected with customers and partners as we innovate to meet their most challenging needs. Q3 also reflected some very difficult decisions we made to right-size the business and I want to recognize the hard work of our employees. We put some points on the board over the past few months, but we are far from satisfied. We view every quarter as a new opportunity to up our game and continue to execute well and that is our mindset entering Q4. With that, I will now turn it over to Dave.
David Zinsner: Thank you, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. Third quarter revenue was $13.3 billion up 4% sequentially and in the upper half of the range we provided in August. Intel Products and Intel Foundry both delivered sequential revenue growth, even as we navigated an inventory drawdown in client. Turning to non-GAAP gross margin, as you know, last quarter, we guided gross margins of 38%, but indicated that we expected incremental costs associated with our spending reduction plan and some of those costs would likely impact non-GAAP gross margin. We recognized approximately $3 billion of non-cash impairment and accelerated depreciation charges, primarily for Intel 7, which are above and beyond our quarter-to-quarter asset adjustments, driving our non-GAAP gross margin down to 18% and EPS to a loss of $0.46. This $3 billion charge reduced non-GAAP gross margin by approximately 2,300 basis points and EPS by approximately $0.61 per share. Beyond those impairment charges, we also were impacted by $15.6 billion of charges that are excluded from our non-GAAP results. These charges have three main components. First, we impaired our deferred tax asset balance by nearly $10 billion which was triggered by cumulative GAAP based losses over the last three years. Second, a $2.6 billion goodwill impairment related to Mobileye, which shows up in our consolidated earnings. And lastly is $2.2 billion associated with the severance of approximately 15% of our employees, aligned with our plan to reduce operating expenses to $17.5 billion and take out $1 billion of other cost of sales next year. This last charge is the only charge with a cash impact. The tax asset impairment charge will not affect cash taxes going forward and full details are in the 10-Q, which will be available tomorrow. Q3 operating cash flow was $4.1 billion up approximately $1.8 billion sequentially on better working capital. We had growth CapEx of $6.5 billion in the quarter, resulting in adjusted free cash flow of negative $2.7 billion. We expect the principal cash cost associated with the restructuring charges to land in Q4 2024. We have $24.1 billion of cash and short-term investments, paid down $2.8 billion of debt in the quarter and remain focused on delevering next year as cash from operations continues to improve. Moving to segment results, Intel Products revenue was $12.2 billion up 3% sequentially. CCG revenue was down 1% quarter-over-quarter as customers worked down their inventory as expected. DCAI revenue was up 10% sequentially, as demand for traditional servers improved. Revenue for NEX was up double-digit sequentially, as elements of this business start to recover off a cyclical bottom. Q3 operating profit for Intel Products was $3.3 billion, 27% of revenue and up $400 million quarter-over-quarter on higher revenue and reduced operating expenses. Operating income was negatively impacted by a $300 million write-down of accelerator inventory due to reduced revenue expectations. Intel Foundry delivered revenue of $4.4 billion up slightly sequentially, driven by increased wafer mix of Intel 4, 3. Foundry operating loss of $5.8 billion was down sequentially materially driven by the $3 billion impairment charges I discussed earlier. We expect losses to continue at approximately the same rate in Q4, minus this impairment charge. Next year, as we move to nodes with a better cost structure and realize the savings associated with the restructuring actions, we expect operating losses to improve significantly. Additionally, we are intensely focused on driving improved returns on our roughly $80 billion of tangible book value, most of which is associated with Intel Foundry. Mobileye reported revenue of $485 million and maintained full year guidance for revenue and adjusted operating income. Q3 revenue was down 8% year-over-year, primarily driven by a more than 50% reduction in shipments to China, where comparisons will become easier as the exposure is now significantly smaller. Cash generation was quite strong, as operating cash flow was well above operating income. Altera delivered revenue of $412 million up 14% sequentially, consistent with guidance to support improved lead times by our distribution partners. Operating margins increased sequentially by 900 basis points on better gross margins and spending discipline. For Q4, we expect high-single-digit sequential revenue growth, as we work with our distribution partners to prepare for the cutover to Altera independent warehouse operations. Overall, billings remain below consumption, as end customers continue to work down inventory tied to previous supply constraints. We anticipate inventory normalization will continue through the first half of next year. Now turning to our Q4 guidance. We successfully worked down client customer inventory levels in Q3, in line with our expectations and despite continued client customer inventory reductions in Q4, CCG should grow towards the higher end of seasonal, often abnormal Q3. Revenue is expected to be flat sequentially across DCAI and NEX businesses in aggregate. Based on these factors, we expect revenue of $13.3 million to $14.3 billion in the fourth quarter. At the midpoint of $13.8 billion, we expect gross margin of approximately 39.5% with a tax rate of 13% and EPS of $0.12, all on a non-GAAP basis. On a GAAP basis, as we continue to execute on our cost actions and portfolio decisions, we expect additional restructuring charges in Q4. We continue to size the business to support trend line revenue growth of 3% to 5% annually with the ability to scale up to 7% to 9% as demand dictates. We anticipate that our 2024 gross and net capital investments will be approximately $25 billion and $11 billion respectively. Our expectation is for adjusted free cash flow to be negative in 2024 due to the restructuring charges disclosed today and the uncertainty around the timing of capital offsets as we approach year-end. In 2025, with OpEx of approximately $17.5 billion and gross and net CapEx of $20 billion to $23 billion and $12 billion to $14 billion, respectively, we expect to achieve positive adjusted free cash flow. Before I close, let me take a moment to remind you of a couple of items as you model 2025 and that today's restructuring and impairment charges are in service to achieve this financial model. First, we are positive on the growing market adoption of the AI PC and our strong product positioning. As our mix of outsourced products and CCG grows in calendar year 2025 and we ramp Intel 18A to support Panther Lake, gross margin expansion could be muted, particularly in the second half. We expect gross margin fall-through to significantly improve in 2026 driven by the vastly improved cost structure of Intel 18A, the return of tiles to a meaningfully underutilized Intel Foundry and operational efficiencies. Second, the estimated $700 million on a GAAP basis of noncontrolled income from Mobileye, Altera, IMS and the portion of the SCIPs earned by our partners is expected to be heavily weighted to the second half of 2025 and will continue to grow in future years with the ramping of wafer outs at our SCIP fabs in Arizona and Ireland. In closing, our profitability remains well below the standards we've set and recognize there's much more work to be done to improve the efficiency of the business. We're encouraged by the progress we made this quarter to rightsize the spending, and our process and product execution, combined with a strong external customer traction in the quarter, give us confidence our strategy will deliver compelling shareholder returns. I'll now turn it back over to John to start the Q&A.
A - John Pitzer: Thank you, Dave. We will now transition to the Q&A portion of our call. [Operator Instructions] With that, Jonathan, can we take the first question, please?
Operator: Certainly. And our first question for today comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.
Ross Seymore: Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question and congrats on solid results. Pat, I want to talk about the 18A transition. Can you just talk about what are the metrics we're going to be able to see externally on this to give people confidence and the ability to ramp it? You've said it's healthy. You've talked about new design wins. But when are some of the true metrics going to come either internally or perhaps even more importantly, externally as your Intel Foundry revenue from an external customer base grows?
Patrick Gelsinger: Yes. Thanks, Ross. And obviously this was a good quarter on the progress that we had, three new customers, Amazon, which we were public on a few weeks ago, Panther Lake and Clearwater Forest internally, two new external customers added to that. So solid progress on it. Clearly, next year, there's not a lot of financial benefit from it because we're only ramping late in the year. Thus, we'll be giving more qualitative metrics on progress as we go through the year, Ross. We'll continue to update, give LDV updates, lifetime deal value for foundry updates as we go through the year. Clearly, as we get more customers, we'll be updating on that progress. It has much larger impacts on '26 financials as we ramp and bring wafers home as well as move into the better margin structure that we'll have on Panther Lake with 18A and across the product line. So we'll be giving clarity in that way, but it will be hard to tie it to specific financials next year, but this is super important for us. For our foundry business, for the industry. So we'll be giving plenty of color as we proceed.
John Pitzer: Ross, do you have a follow-up question, please?
Ross Seymore: Yes, I do. One for Dave on the gross margin side of things. Just somewhat chronologically, ex the charges, it looks like you're about a 41% gross margin in the second or excuse me the third quarter. I know that's not where you want to be overall, but that's much better than you guided. So what was the cause of the upside there? Why is it going down in the fourth quarter? And what are the big picture puts and takes that you're alluding to about the gross margin leverage or lack thereof, especially as we get into the second half of next year?
David Zinsner: Yes. Good question. Okay. So I would say the third quarter surprise was really associated with better sell-through of previously reserved inventory. I think that was the thing that upsided us the most in the third quarter. As we look into the fourth quarter, we'll have that better sell-through won't repeat itself. So that will be a fundamental driver of why the gross margins kind of slipped down absent the impairment charge. And additionally, we're going to have more start-up costs in the fourth quarter associated with 18A than we did in the third quarter. So that's going to put a little pressure on the gross margins. But I do think the 39.5% guide at the midpoint for the fourth quarter is a pretty clean guide. It has less kind of noise around it than some of the previous quarters. So I think it's a good kind of metric to kind of start to inform how '25 will look in terms of gross margins. We're not going to provide guidance yet on '25. It's still early. I would say the puts and takes of it are, for sure, as Pat indicated, we're all in on AI PC and in particular, we're all in on Lunar Lake, which is our next-generation product. As you know, Lunar Lake has the memory in the package, that affects the gross margins, and I think it's going to weigh down the gross margins on the product side of the business for us in '25. Now as you know, Panther Lake is the next one, the margins get better just at the product level, but they also include more mix of wafers internally, which also helps the foundry business. So as we get more volume ramping in '26 and Panther Lake, that's going to be helpful for gross margins. On the Foundry side, we will see improvement next year. You won't see it because we don't report it at that level, but we will see gross margin improvement on the Foundry side as we step into '25, partly because of the reductions we talked about. As we talked about, we're going to reduce our spending by more than $10 billion, $1 billion of it is directly in cost of sales associated with the Intel Foundry business getting more efficient in terms of their spend. Additionally, we're just going to be mixing more to EUV wafers. EUV wafers have a better pricing dynamic, they have a better cost structure on a relative basis. So we see improvement there. And I've been pleased with just the new model of managing the Foundry business with a P&L. I've seen all kinds of better decision-making going on, both at Foundry and at the Product side just to optimize their cost structure in a better way, and that should help as well. Longer term, I just think as we continually improve our product portfolio, both in Foundry and Products, that usually commands a better margin profile and also longer term be a tailwind. But not yet, I think, something that shows up meaningfully in '25.
Patrick Gelsinger: And I would just add that, as we indicated on our last quarter's earnings call, as we go through this restructuring phase, we're in the next phase of our transformation. With that, we're much more focused on the sustainable business model results, shareholder return, financial disciplines. The first phase is very much about getting back in the game. Getting process in place, getting shell ahead in place, getting our products competitive. So I think overall, Ross, we're going to be much more focused on it. Those are the tough actions we've taken this quarter on getting our cost base where we need to be. And overall, the operating margin, the gross margins of the company, overall cost base, CapEx investment, they're just getting a lot more attention from us as we go forward.
Ross Seymore: Thank you.
John Pitzer: Thank you, Ross. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?
Operator: Certainly. And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question, please.
Timothy Arcuri: Pat, I think you mentioned at a conference maybe in September that defect density on 18A is you said sub 0.4, I think. Can you just talk about how that translates to yields? Is that sort of a good enough number to translate into high volume? And what sort of number for, say, defect density does a customer want to see when they're looking at your foundry?
Patrick Gelsinger: Yes. Defect density, it's a complex conversation, Tim, because that big die sizes have lower percent yields, right, even at the same defect density. So it's very variable depending on the particular die size of the product. So when we said the D0 of less than 0.4, that was a healthy yield number at this phase of the process development, that's not yet a high-volume production yield level. But we're not at that phase of the process development yet for 18A. So it's a number that says we are at where we'd want to be at this point in the process development life cycle. Clearly, as you bring it to high-volume production, which we'll be doing in the second half of next year, we have to be markedly lower than that in terms of defect density. But we believe that we see all the signs, the signals, and we're managing this very carefully to accomplish that as we get to next year. Similarly, as we look at today's Intel 3, we're accomplishing the defect densities with the maturity levels that we'd expect on that. But again, yield in the process technology is something you're never done with, right? You hit key milestones on quality yield and then you go into high-volume production and you continue to work on that going forward. I'd also emphasize that the Arizona ramp is important for us as we move to 18A. And that comes online in volume in the second half of next year and that's all on track as well as we have tool move-ins, EUV tools and qualification now, first wafers coming out of the volume fab in Arizona in Q1 of next year. So overall, we're progressing well, and we'll be giving you updates as we proceed.
John Pitzer: Tim, do you have a follow-up question?
Timothy Arcuri: I do. Yes. I have a question on Panther Lake, Pat. So I know that it's coming back in-house, but we do still hear that most tiles are still being outsourced. Can you speak to that? Is that a change or was that always the plan? And I guess when you look at Nova Lake on the desktop side, is it still being dual track, meaning that there is still an option that it could be outsourced or is it guaranteed to be brought back in-house? Thanks.
Patrick Gelsinger: Yes. Thank you. Panther Lake, some tiles would be external, but the majority of the millimeter square in the package are back internal. It's more 70% plus of the silicon area is back in-house. So the majority of Panther Lake wafer capacity by a good margin is coming back inside for Intel. Nova Lake, we definitely have some SKUs that we're looking at continuing to leverage externally, but the large majority of Nova Lake and more of the additional tiles have come back in-house as well. So we still have some flexibility in the Nova Lake product, but the large majority of that is committed to the Intel Product or Intel Foundry. So overall, we are absolutely executing on the bringing wafer's home strategy that we've laid out. That said, TSMC has been a great partner. Clearly, Lunar Lake has demonstrated the strength of the partnership and one that we'll use selectively in our product lines for the future. But a large percentage of wafers coming home that meaningfully fills our factories that also meaningfully improves the margin structure of Intel and Intel Products.
John Pitzer: Thanks, Tim. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?
Operator: Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your question, please.
C.J. Muse: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow on that last question. In terms of the optionality in terms of securing leading-edge capacity, obviously, you're all in on 18A. But if that were to get delayed, what do you have in terms of negotiated capabilities in terms of securing capacity in '26, '27. And on the other hand, if 18A proves to be more successful, how are you thinking about timeframe being more aggressive in terms of adding capacity in Arizona?
Patrick Gelsinger: Yes. Thank you, C.J. I'll say we have optionality in the product portfolio that way. We have more resilience in our supply chain than competition does as a result. So we feel quite good about that. We continue to really value the relationship, right, with TSMC and our product portfolio is set up very nicely with respect to 18A capacity. Given our shell ahead strategy and the investments that we've made over the last several years, we have a lot of flexibility to scale up if market conditions require for our products, but also if market conditions require for our Foundry customers as well. And given the margin stacking nature that we uniquely are able to benefit from every wafer we bring home adds to the margin structure of Intel in a meaningful way. So we really are setting ourselves up very nicely for the future. And as we make progress on 18A,18AP, 14A, an aggressive road map, advanced packaging, which is uniquely based on Intel technologies and finding more momentum in our product line, but also in our Foundry customers, we really are starting to see the benefits of the long-term strategy that we've put in place with Intel Products with Intel Foundry.
John Pitzer: C.J., do you have a follow-up question?
C.J. Muse: I do. Following the better the consensus guide for Q4, could you give us an early read on how you're thinking about seasonality into Q1?
David Zinsner: Yes. So we're not going to provide, C.J., guidance for Q1. Let's work on Q4, and we can update you in January. But the average seasonality for Q1 is in the 8% to 10% range and we'll give you more color as we get into next quarter's earnings, whether we are going to be seasonal or see things differently than that.
Patrick Gelsinger: Yes. And I'd say, overall, it's hard to say. We have geopolitical factors and other things that the world is looking at and I don't think we have any wisdom beyond that at this point. We're clearly trying to manage the business to a cost structure that we're very comfortable with. But as we indicated by the last question, C.J., we have a lot of flexibility to scale up if necessary or we have the opportunity to do that as well. And overall, there's quite a bit of uncertainty, I think, in the marketplace, so our strategy positions us well to deal with those overall uncertainties that we don't control, but we're very committed to control what we can directly do.
John Pitzer: Thank you, C.J. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?
Operator: Certainly. And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your question, please.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. For the first one, I wanted to go back to 2025 and how we should kind of conceptually look at it. I think at one point, in the trend line of 3% to 5% growth top line. Is that how we should think about sales? And then on the gross margin side, Dave, you said that muted expansion, right. And if I look at your Q4 of 39.5%, is that sort of what you imply for 2025? And I asked that because I think at some other point, you also mentioned headwinds in the second half of '25. So that got me confused as to whether it could dip below these levels. So just I know you're not giving '25 outlook, but you did give a trend line number and you did kind of give us the 39.5% metric. So any color would be very useful.
David Zinsner: Yes. So on revenue growth, again, we're not going to, for 2025, I'd say just that we are managing the business in terms of how we're investing in the business to a 3% to 5% growth rate next year, but over time, in our minds. And things turn out to be better, then that's good fall through to us from a profitability perspective. I wasn't suggesting that you take the 39.5%, you move it every quarter. Clearly, every quarter is going to have some unique aspects to it. Only that 39.5% was a quarter in which it was clean and it was a good proxy to start the calculation for the full year of '25. You're right, yes, we do see more headwind in the second half versus the first half given Lunar Lake becoming a more meaningful part of the volume over time for 2025. Again, that starts to improve in the following year as Panther Lake becomes more and more meaningful part of the volume for the client business in 2026.
John Pitzer: Vivek, do you have a follow-up question, please?
Vivek Arya: Yes. Thank you, John. So maybe one for Pat. Pat, what does the future look like for Intel's data center if there is no competitive AI product. Is just being CPU-centric good enough? At what point does the CPU get commoditized like custom chips or replaced with ARM-based products. What is Intel's AI strategy right now?
Patrick Gelsinger: Yes. Thank you, Vivek. Maybe three different perspectives just to highlight. Number one is the CPU plays an increasing role in data center AI compute. Even in cloud-based environments today, head nodes are an area of strength for Intel Xeon already, as I reflected in my comments. As you go into enterprise AI, we expect to place a more prominent role, databases, embedding, refinement or much more attuned to CPU workloads. And our strategy there is CPU plus accelerator or CPU plus Gaudi. So we see the enterprise use cases having a very long life associated with them going forward. Second, as I said, Gaudi 3, good product and seeing good early interest from customers. We mentioned the IBM win, but a good pipeline of activities there. So Xeon plus accelerator in that regard. And as we launched this quarter, we also have the x86 Ecosystem Advisory. We are breathing life into the x86 architecture and we're seeing extraordinary interest from the industry, from luminaries and how we build on that momentum. So we definitely want to be very front footed with x86 for a full range of use cases, but also the AI use cases as well and the industry is quite interested in joining us participating and expanding the world's greatest architecture of all time. The most industry influence, the broadest number of ISVs and applications and continuing that momentum forward.
John Pitzer: Thank you, Vivek. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?
Operator: Certainly. And our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your question, please.
Aaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I appreciate it. Two questions, if I can as well. So first on the Foundry business as you guys ramp that we start to focus on the ramp of 18A looking forward. Given the pipeline of the design wins that you guys have talked about. I'm curious, how large is your external piece of that, call it, $4.4 billion revenue in this most recent quarter. I think it was about $77 million last quarter. And how do we think about the pace of that kind of inflecting higher as we look out into '25, '26? And I'm just curious how you would define success in that external business?
Patrick Gelsinger: Yes. So overall the external Foundry business will be a modest portion, right, of the Foundry business for the next couple of years. The Foundry revenues will be dominated by the internal products as we've been building that portfolio for many years. So we'll ramp as we go through the rest of the decade. We said our financial objectives by the end of the decade are $15 billion plus of external Foundry revenue. We'll be giving periodic updates on LDV, lifetime deal value of external Foundry customers as we go forward. And indicators like we did this quarter of new design wins, new customers coming online. But the reported numbers for Intel Foundry will be substantially dominated by the Intel Products for the next couple of years. That said, we saw a nice growth, right, quarter-on-quarter in the external Foundry business and we did break profitable for the advanced packaging portion of that business in Q3. So we are seeing nice growth characteristics, nice business characteristics, and we'll be giving more updates as we go forward. Dave, anything to add on that?
David Zinsner: No, I mean, other than it was up a bit this quarter, but still dominated by internal business within the Intel Foundry business.
John Pitzer: Aaron, do you have a follow-up question?
Aaron Rakers: Yes, I do. Thanks. Real quickly on the server side of the business kind of off the prior question. I guess there's a continual discussion or debate of like Intel's positioning as far as stabilizing or recapturing its share position in x86 service. I'm curious as we think about Granite Rapids, we think about Clearwater Forest and Diamond Rapids. How do you characterize your ability to kind of your views of recapturing share in that server CPU market? Thank you.
Patrick Gelsinger: Yes. Thank you, Aaron. And I'd say our goal is stabilize our position and grow from that position. And this was a solid quarter for our execution. Clearly, Xeon 6, Granite Rapids and Sierra Forest now fully shipping and available are important milestones. Obviously, the AWS deal was a very nice deal because it reinforces Xeon, but also our expanding role of customization. So I'll say the first order of business is hold share and then regain share. The strength that we've seen for Xeon is this AI head nodes, these AI use cases. We have very good performance on Granite Rapids for AI use cases. And as we look to the future, getting just more competitive on basic power performance per core and fighting for share there is clearly the initiatives that we have underway. Clearwater Forest powered on, right, showing health of 18A, Diamond Rapids will shortly go into fab. So the roadmap is in good solid shape as well. So I'd say, overall, we feel that is a good pathway. And if I add to the last question as well for AI, I'd also emphasize that all of the energy has been in training. And all of us all of that associated with cloud-based training. But training is creating the weather model, not using it. And increasingly, I think, every analyst is putting more and more attention to how do we use those models? How do we inferencing against them? How do we retrain for our localized data? How do we complement that with RAG and database embeddings and all of those are areas that are much more CPU-centric. So the strength of our CPU and its unique power in some of these AI use cases as well as something we see the market coming more toward us and the strength that we've traditionally had.
John Pitzer: Thank you. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?
Operator: Certainly. And our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from Raymond James. Your question, please.
Srini Pajjuri: Thank you. Pat, I have a question on the Foundry side, in particular, the packaging business you have. I know even though there's a lot of skepticism about 18A, but I think you guys have pretty good packaging technology, and it's proven, I believe, if I look at EMIB and Foveros, et cetera. So my question is, given the tightness in the packaging industry right now, I would have thought we would see more interest in your packaging services. So I'm just curious as to why we are not seeing that. Is it because it's, I guess, there must be some nuances of using your packaging with TSM wafers. I'm just curious as to why we are not seeing more interest.
Patrick Gelsinger: Well, I'd say we do see significant interest in this area and moving your supply chains, though, is complicated and takes qualification time and many of these designs were first designed on CoWAS, and now they're looking at Foveros, and then they're looking at the unique technologies that we have like EMIB as well. So we actually see very good momentum in that area. Now those aren't as revenue-producing as wafer design, so they're not nearly, right, as large in size, but the pipeline of activities is very strong. And the quarter-on-quarter improvements we saw were largely driven by advanced packaging. Most of the external revenue that we'll see, which will be nicely up year-on-year as we go into '25 in the external Foundry will be advanced packaging and we also see healthy margins for that technology as well. So moving supply chain is always hard and slow, but the progress that we've seen already the design wins that we already include in our LDV and then the pipeline of additional designs that we are engaging in, all of us give us great optimism that this becomes a foundational piece of our Foundry business for the long-term. And as I noted in an earlier comment, we did see our advanced packaging now as a profitable business, a standalone by itself as well.
John Pitzer: Srini, do you have a follow-up question?
Srini Pajjuri: Yes, I do. Thank you. I guess a question on the gross margin side, Dave. I guess there are two issues impacting your PC gross margins. One, the wafer outsourcing and the other, you said packaging of the memory. I'm just curious how much of an impact that memory packaging is having on your gross margin? I suppose that helps your ASPs, but I guess it hurts your gross margin percent. So just curious to know how much of an impact that's having. And then maybe for Pat, architecturally, why do we need to, I guess, combine memory in one package? And is this something that's going to be ongoing or is it just a one-off with, I guess, Lunar and Meteor Lake? Thank you.
David Zinsner: Yes. And just to be clear, it's exclusive to Lunar Lake, but not Meteor Lake. And it's having a pretty meaningful impact, a significant impact on Lunar Lake's gross margins, and originally we were like a third of the volume in terms of our expectations next year on Lunar Lake when we recognized how important the AI PC market would be and how good this part was competitively. We pushed the volume significantly up. And so that has put some reasonable pressure on the gross margins for the total company.
Patrick Gelsinger: Yes. And maybe architecturally, the second half of that question, Lunar Lake was initially designed to be a niche product that we wanted to achieve highest performance and great battery life, capability, and then AI PC occurred. And with AI PC, it went from being a niche product to a pretty high-volume product. Now relatively speaking, we're not talking about 50 million, 100 million units, but a meaningful portion of our total mix from a relatively small piece of it as well. So as that shift occurred, obviously, this became a bigger margin implication both for Lunar Lake and for the company overall. But we were very pleased to have the option to scale Lunar Lake and higher volume because of the momentum energy around the AI PC category. That's at a volume product and a volume industry like the PC industry, you don't want to have volume memory going through that channel. It's not a good way to run the business. So it really is, for us, a one-off with Lunar Lake. That will not be the case with Panther Lake, Nova Lake and its successors as well. We'll build it in a more traditional way with memory off package in the CPU, GPU, NPU and I/O capabilities in the package. But volume memory will be off package in the roadmap going forward. And we won't have this kind of impact that we're dealing with for '25 in the margin structure specifically around Lunar Lake. But again it's a great product. And we're happy that we have it in the portfolio and we've scaled it commensurate with the enthusiasm of the AI PC category.
John Pitzer: Thanks, Srini. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?
Operator: Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Caso from Wolfe Research. Your question please.
Chris Caso: Yes, thank you. Good evening. I guess the first question is on both CapEx and OpEx as you go through next year. And I think you were a bit clear about what the plans are and what the resulting free cash flow is. I guess, Dave, the question is how much flex maybe in those numbers, I guess, as you go through '25 and '26 as well given the fact that you do have to invest in new technology nodes, how much flex is there for changes in market conditions. Also recognize that you don't have very much revenue growth in the plan for that as well.
David Zinsner: Yes. I think on the $17.5 billion for OpEx, that's a pretty firm plan. I mean, obviously, we can make some adjustments here or there, if necessary. But we think we've rightsized the investments to invest in the most important areas that Pat and the team want to pursue. And so that, I would say, is relatively firm. Maybe there's just a little bit of variability there that we can make adjustments as we kind of progress through the year. The CapEx, there are three components to CapEx. There is what we're going to invest for the process, advancing the process. There's investment associated with this shell ahead and there's investments associated with capacity. We're always going to make those investments to advance the process. That will always be the case. Shell ahead, we will, but we have largely caught up, I think. And so now we're going to be more measured, I think, as we look to increasing our shell capacity. And then capacity itself then becomes the flex, the tooling out of shells, and we're kind of modulating that based on what we see in terms of demand and, of course, managing it relative to cash flow. So there obviously is flexibility there as we progress through the year and into the following year. And our goal is to generate free cash flow to generate adjusted free cash flow next year and there and onwards. So we'll be managing net CapEx accordingly. I guess the one other variable to the net CapEx would be any of the offsets. And of course we're aggressively pursuing offsets, some of which we know will already show up next year. SCIP will be a component of our offsets next year. We're also going to start to see some more meaningful impact from the investment tax credit next year, which we have already baked into the forecast.
Patrick Gelsinger: Chris, the thing I would, just to add a little bit to that, Chris, would be that now that we've gotten an EUV fleet, right, into our CapEx base, we have a lot more flexibility across that fleet. Largely, the CapEx used for Intel 3, 18A and 14A highly leveraged across it. So we're much more building to overall capacity requirements and not this very rapid 5 nodes, 4 years, get back to a modern fleet of capability. Obviously, the other point to add to that is now that we have finished this 5 nodes, 4 years, we're progressing to a more normal cadence of new technologies as opposed to this racing through capital. So that will also give us additional flexibility. And I'll say largely with the singular exception of high NA, EUV, the equipment bases are almost entirely the same across the 14A node as well. And even at high NA, we've built flexibility into the TD development that we have optionality to include or not include that as a central part of it. So we've built a lot of capacity. Now we're going to leverage that capacity in much more efficient ways for both a overall high-volume manufacturing and a TD leverage going forward.
John Pitzer: Chris, do you have a quick follow-on?
Chris Caso: I do. And I mean it's a good segue in the next question, Pat, and it's I guess a question about your comments on Better Together. And if you could kind of explain the rationale of why you think that's the case, obviously, there's various opinions on that. And if Intel would be willing or has looked at anything strategic beyond what the current plan is right now?
Patrick Gelsinger: Yes. And I'll just say, we're very comfortable that moving to the subsidiary model as we outlined in the last earnings call, it gives us, I'll say, three things that we're aiming for greater operational rate integrity, right, as we create that clear separation, the opportunity to be able to communicate that more clearly and definitively to our external customers and then the potential to fund and manage the capital requirements of Foundry. That said, the vast majority of volumes through the decade come from Intel Products. The synergies of that co-development and customer zero aspect is very substantial as we see it. And the benefits that we get from the overall cash flows and managing the balance sheet of the company as we go forward are highly beneficial as well. So for all those reasons, our simple view is distinct but Better Together.
John Pitzer: Thanks, Chris. Jonathan, we've got time for one last question, please.
Operator: Certainly. And our final question for today comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.
Joseph Moore: Great. Thank you. In your opening remarks, you talked about narrowing the product focus and prioritizing x86. Can you talk about, practically speaking, what happens there? Does that mean, are there other areas that you're investing less in to focus more on x86? Is that a mindset shift, organizational shift? Just what do you mean by that?
Patrick Gelsinger: Yes. And there's a lot of details behind it, Joe, but I'll just maybe give a couple of quick examples. We, for instance, create complexity in the server product line E-Cores, P-Cores across different socket types that complexity was maybe appropriate when the business was substantially larger and growing. At its current size, it puts too much complexity on our development as well as our customers and OEM, how many SKUs they're developing. So we've taken steps to simplify the product line, have fewer SKUs to cover the marketplace, and we're focused on the efficiencies associated with that. Similarly, in the client product area, simplifying the roadmap, fewer SKUs to cover it. How are we handling graphics and how that is increasingly becoming a large integrated graphics capabilities. So less need for discrete graphics in the market going forward. So simplifying the roadmap in those areas. And then the steps we took around our CCG and Edge business to be able to bring that together for better reach to the market, leveraging our core investments. So a variety of those, but many others behind that as we get ourselves, I'll say, in fighting shape that allows us to leverage our investments, hit our $17.5 billion OpEx that Dave spoke about and still have a very solid growth in a more profitable way for the future.
John Pitzer: Joe, do you have a quick follow-on?
Joseph Moore: Yes, I do. To the extent that you are kind of prioritizing the x86 leadership that you have. Does anything shift in the IDM 2.0 model? Is it -- they referenced that the arm's length relationship with IFS is still going really well. Like is that still a focus? Is there a benefit to if the focus is more on internal Foundry versus excess to marrying those business more tightly? Just how do you think about that relationship?
Patrick Gelsinger: Yes. And clearly external Foundry, right, requires a different view of how you run and manage that business, but the wafers, the cash flows come from the internal business. So this subsidiary model is a key piece of how we're going to drive that cultural transformation, but still bring the success of an at-scale leading-edge, western-centered Foundry model. That is an extraordinary asset for us, for the industry and for the world. So we're very focused on making that successful. This has been an extraordinary journey to accomplish 5 nodes in 4 years and bring us from years behind to a leadership position in technology. And wow, it's just stunning to see what our TD teams have been able to accomplish there, but we're not done. We have a lot of work in front of us yet. We're well on our way to completing what will be one of the most seminal restructuring in the history, the steps that we took in our financial restructuring this quarter was very critical to be able to bring us to a point that we can say we have the capacity to and driving to long-term shareholder return. So maybe just as we wrap up, thank you, as always for joining the call. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss our progress, the actions we've taken. Q3 was a good step. Now we need to finish the year strong and prepare for 2025. We're determined to get it right and I look forward to the updates along the way. Thank you and look forward to speaking to you all again soon.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",2024-10-31
INTC,2024,4,2024-Q4-INTC,"Operator: Thank you for standing by, and welcome to Intel Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. John Pitzer, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
John Pitzer: Thank you, Jonathan, and good afternoon to everyone joining us today. By now, you should have received a copy of the Q4 earnings release and earnings presentation, both of which are available on our Investor Relations website, intc.com. For those joining us online today, the earnings presentation is also available in our webcast window. I'm joined today by our Interim co-CEOs, Michelle Johnston Holthaus; and Dave Zinsner. As you know, Michelle is also CEO of Intel Products; and Dave continues to serve as Intel CFO. In a few moments, Michelle will open up with some summary comments before providing more detail on Intel Products. Dave will then discuss Intel Foundry and the overall financials, including our Q1 guidance. Before we begin, please note that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. And as such, are subject to various risks and uncertainties. It also contains references to non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information to our investors. Our earnings release, most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC provide more information on specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. They also provide additional information on our non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations where appropriate to our corresponding GAAP financial measures. With that, let me turn things over to Michelle.
Michelle Johnston Holthaus: Thank you, John, and let me add my welcome. It's been roughly two months since Dave and I stepped into our roles as interim co-CEOs. From day one, we have been working closely together alongside the Board to drive better execution of our strategy. There are no quick fixes. And we are committed to improving our performance and rebuilding our credibility through persistent hard work that delivers tangible results. As part of this, we are driving more focused investments across the business. We cannot be all things to all people, and we are prioritizing areas where we can drive differentiated value. We are also continuing to simplify our business and become a leaner, more efficient company. And most of all, we’re doing a better job of listening to our customers to ensure we meet their needs. Q4 was a step in the right direction. We delivered revenue, gross margin and EPS above our guide. Intel Products executed to drive revenue in the quarter, even as PC inventory continue to normalize. And Intel Foundry drove incremental operating efficiencies while achieving key grant related milestones, which supported solid upside to gross margins. As co-CEOs, you can expect us to be very straightforward and direct. We only make commitments, we are confident we can deliver. We firmly believe that what we say is not nearly as important, as what we do. And everything we do must be in service of our customers. Innovating to solve their most pressing challenges is the surest path to creating shareholder value. This is the mindset I have brought to my position as the CEO of Intel Products. This is a great business with great people, partners and IP to design world-class products from edge-to-cloud. I take nothing for granted. But I firmly believe that the core x86 architecture and the ecosystem we have built and invested in over the decades, create a solid foundation for success. Our customers share this view. But they need us to improve our execution and hit our commitments. I am setting clear priorities and directions in each business to drive better outcomes. I think about Intel products in three buckets. First, client edge; second traditional data center; and third, the AI data center. Let me spend a few moments on each. In client, Intel CPUs power roughly seven out of every 10 PCs. This is a strong position that gives us advantages in the market. That said, the market is becoming more competitive, especially as we see new entrants trying to participate in the AI PC category. Personally, I thrive on competition. It drives a healthy paranoia across everything we do, and we are using it as motivation to up our game even more. The success of Core Ultra across, Meteor Lake, Arrow Lake and Lunar Lake has established Intel as the market leader in AI PC CPUs, and we remain on track to ship more than 100 million cumulative systems by the end of 2025. We are innovating at scale unlike any of our competitors. This was on display earlier this month at CES, where we launched the enterprise versions of our AI CPUs with compelling new features to Intel vPro. This is a testament to the strong ecosystem we have built with IT departments, around manageability, security, trust and brand. And we expect these investments to possession us well, as corporations begin their migration to Windows 11. Alongside our investments in enterprise, our ecosystem reach also positions us well in AI PC consumer markets. We are working with more than 200 ISVs across more than 400 features to optimize their software on our silicon. I'm excited about the new applications I'm seeing in the pipeline that will begin to proliferate over the coming months. Our goal is to innovate, partner and fortify our position, as the preferred CPU of choice. Looking ahead to the rest of the year, we will strengthen our client road map with the launch of Panther Lake, our lead product on Intel 18A in the second half of 2025. As the first volume customer of Intel 18A, I see the progress that Intel Foundry is making on performance and yields, and I look forward to being in production in the second half, as we demonstrate the benefits of our world-class design and process technology capabilities. 2026 is even more exciting from a client perspective as Panther Lake achieved meaningful volumes, and we introduced our next-generation client family code named Nova Lake. Both will provide strong performance across the entire PC stack, with significantly better costs and margins for us, enhancing our competitive position and reinforcing our value proposition to our partners and customers. Let me now turn to our traditional data center business. The team has made good progress towards strengthening our offerings and driving better, more predictable execution. This year is all about improving Xeon's competitive position, as we fight harder to close the gap to competition. The ramp of Granite Rapids has been a good first step. We are also making good progress on Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A server product that we plan to launch in the first half of next year. All of this provides a strong foundation on which to build as we execute. The world's data center workloads still primarily run on Intel Silicon, and we have a strong ecosystem, especially within Enterprise. We are going to leverage these strengths, as we work to stabilize our market share in 2025. One of the ways we'll do this is by reengaging the x86 ecosystem. We have seen a positive response from the x86 ecosystem advisory group, we formed last fall, and we are encouraged by the enthusiasm for building both semi-custom and custom products. This is a big area of opportunity for the business, and we look forward to talking more about this as we have news to share. Turning to the AI data center. I will start by saying that this is an attractive market for us over time, but I am not happy with where we are today. On the one hand, we have a leading position as the host CPU for AI servers. And we continue to see a significant opportunity for CPU based inference on-prem and at the edge, as AI-infused applications proliferate. On the other hand, we are not yet participating in the cloud-based AI data center market in a meaningful way. We have learned a lot as we have ramped Gaudi, and we’re applying those learnings going forward. One of the immediate actions I have taken is to simplify our road map and concentrate our resources. Many of you heard me temper expectations on Falcon Shores last month. Based on industry feedback, we plan to leverage Falcon Shores as an internal test chip only without bringing it to market. This will support our efforts to develop a system-level solution at rack scale with Jaguar Shores to address the AI data center. More broadly, as I think about our AI opportunity, my focus is on the problems our customers are trying to solve, most notably, to lower the cost and increase the efficiency of compute. AI is not a market in the traditional sense. It's an enabling application that needs to span across the compute continuum from data center to the edge. As such, a one-size-fits-all approach will not work, and I can see clear opportunities to leverage our core assets in new ways to drive the most compelling total cost of ownership across the continuum. Before I turn the call over to Dave, let me close by speaking as Intel Foundry’s largest wafer customer. I have a pretty simple approach. When we are able to combine world-class products with world-class process technology, we win. As CEO of Intel Products, I’ll always make process technology decisions based on what is best for my customers. And Intel Foundry will need to earn my business every day, just as I need to earn the business of my customers. Having said that, I am confident in the Intel Foundry team ability to support my current and future product roadmap. And I’m excited to do more business with them as their process technology continues to advance. A stronger Intel Products, combined with a more competitive Intel Foundry, is a recipe for success for Intel overall. Dave over to you.
David Zinsner: Thanks, Michelle. Let me add my welcome. I’m going to address three topics today, update on Intel Foundry; second, Q4 and full-year financials; and, third, our Q1 guidance. Starting with Intel Foundry. I have had an opportunity to meet with a number of our partners and potential customers for Intel Foundry over the last couple months. I come away from those meetings encouraged by the opportunity we have in front of us, and I have received clear feedback on what our customers need from us to succeed. This starts with our execution on Intel 18A. This has been an area of good progress. Like any new process, there have been puts and takes along the way, but overall we are confident that we are delivering a competitive process. We are excited by the launch of Panther Lake this year and the internal ramp of Intel 18A in the second half that will support increased volumes and improved profitability in 2026. From the perspective of external customers, Intel 18A is a very competitive offering that gives each of them a reason to engage with us. However, foundry wins are about more than just technology. Trust is also a significant factor. Customers must believe you can execute consistently and be willing to invest in IP to port a design to a new foundry. That’s why past transitions in the industry have generally started with customers giving new foundry partners, smaller volumes then gradually increasing as trust grows. We have made good progress. But to accelerate this, I am asking the team to re-double their efforts on ease-of-porting, IP availability and best-known foundry methods. I am particularly pleased by the willingness of our suppliers and partners to engage with us, augmenting our expertise and hard work with theirs. Job Number 1, is earning the customer’s trust. The Intel 18A design wins to-date provide good validation of the strategy, and we continue to have a healthy RFQ pipeline of potential customers. But we won’t win every deal out of the gates. We will be selective and focus on areas, where we are confident that we can be a meaningful contributor to the success of our customer, and we look forward to updating you as RFQs become wins. In addition, we continue to have good momentum in advanced packaging and in our collaborations with Tower Semiconductor and UMC. All three are critical to utilize our assets longer for higher rates of return. This is a good segue into my other key areas of focus for Intel Foundry: improving our financials and making sure that we are deploying your capital appropriately. At roughly $18 billion in revenue, Intel Foundry today is larger than all but one external foundry. That is clearly not reflected on our P&L with negative gross margins and a greater than $13 billion operating loss in 2024. We are going to systematically attack our costs and remain highly focused on our goal of delivering break-even operating income for Intel Foundry by the end of 2027, and we expect to demonstrate improvements this year. The financial benefits of shifting our wafer volumes from Intel 7 to Intel 18A, along with learning to run our fabs more efficiently and our process nodes longer, will be important drivers of improving our financials. Beyond 2027, we need to drive to cash flow from operations that support our capital spending needs and ultimately generate a great return on your capital. I remain very optimistic on our opportunity at Intel Foundry. The pervasive growth of AI is driving accelerating and unprecedented demand for silicon and there continues to be an unmet need for greater choice and overall manufacturing capacity in the industry today. TSMC is a valued supplier to Intel Products and important partner to IMS, and they have established a very high standard for what it takes to be a world-class foundry. But the market overall needs multiple players, and, as we execute, Intel Foundry has a very important role to play globally and especially here in the U.S., where we continue to invest in leading-edge R&D and manufacturing capacity. We were also pleased to sign with the U.S. Department of Commerce a definitive agreement awarding us up to $7.86 billion in grants. As you know, these grants are milestone-based, and we have already received $1.1 billion in Q4 and have received an additional $1.1 billion in January of Q1. In addition, we continue to make good progress building out our Secure Enclave in partnership with the Department of Defense. We look forward to continued engagement with the Trump administration, as we advance this work and support their efforts to strengthen U.S. technology and manufacturing leadership. Finally, as you will recall, we announced our intention to establish an independent subsidiary structure for Intel Foundry to provide clear governance and operational separation. This structure also enables us to seek additional funding options from both strategic and financial partners, which we are now actively beginning to explore. Let me now turn to our consolidated financial results and Q1 guidance. Fourth [technical difficulty] $14.3 billion, up 7% sequentially and at the high end of the range we provided in October, as a result of solid growth in CCG, equipment sales at IMS and the edge business of NEX. Non-GAAP gross margin came in at 42.1%, 260 basis points ahead of guidance on higher revenue, better costs and the receipt of our first CHIPs grants, offset partially by inventory reserves related to Gaudi. We delivered fourth quarter earnings per share of $0.13 versus our guidance of $0.12. Higher revenue, stronger gross margin and improved operating leverage was offset by lower interest and other income, which includes an accrual related to our second SCIP agreement of roughly $750 million, reflecting an adjustment in our planned capacity ramp in Ireland. In Q2, we began the process of resizing our expense structure to support more modest long-term growth, including adjusting our capacity plans to more conservative levels, driving impairments in Q3 and this accrual in Q4. Q4 operating cash flow was positive $3.2 billion, down approximately $900 million sequentially due to the cash outlays associated with our Q3 restructuring charges. We had gross CapEx of $6.3 billion with offsets of $1.6 billion in the quarter resulting in an adjusted free cash flow of negative $1.5 billion. As I mentioned earlier, we also received a portion of the CHIPs grants this quarter. For the full year, revenue was $53.1 billion, down 2.1% year-over-year. Modest year-over-year growth in Intel Products was more than offset by lower revenue at Mobileye and Altera, as well as the forecasted decline in Foundry Services due to the end of life on traditional packaging revenue. Full year gross margin was 36% and down 760 basis points due to Q3 impairments, lower revenue and inventory impacts. Full-year EPS was minus $0.13 and down $1.18 on lower revenue, lower gross margin and higher period charges. We generated $8.3 billion in cash from operations, made $24 billion of gross capital investments and generated capital offsets of approximately $13.4 billion from SCIP partner contributions and government grants and incentives. As a result, adjusted free cash flow was $2.2 billion and we ended the year with $22.1 billion of cash and short-term investments. Moving to segment results for Q4. Intel Products revenue was $13 billion, up 7% sequentially. CCG revenue was up 9% quarter-over-quarter as the rate at which our customers digested inventory slowed meaningfully from Q3. While difficult to quantify, we suspect a portion of Q4 revenue upside was due to customers hedging against potential tariffs. DCAI revenue was up slightly sequentially off a better-than-expected Q3, as demand for traditional servers remained stable. Revenue for NEX was up 7.5% sequentially and is now up more than 20% from Q2 lows, as customers are returning to more normal buying patterns especially in our edge business. Operating profit for Intel Products was $3.6 billion, 28% of revenue, and up $300 million quarter-over-quarter on higher revenue and reduced operating expenses. Intel Foundry delivered revenue of $4.5 billion, up 3% sequentially, on increased EUV wafer mix and higher equipment sales by IMS. EUV wafer revenue grew from 1% of total revenue in 2023 to greater than 5% in 2024. Intel Foundry operating loss in Q4 of $2.3 billion improved meaningfully sequentially as Q3 was impacted by $3.1 billion of impairments. Excluding impairments, operating loss would have been roughly flat quarter-on-quarter. Turning to All Other. Mobileye reported revenue of $490 million, up 1% sequentially, with operating profit of $103 million, and earlier today guided for full year 2025 increases to both revenue and operating income. Altera delivered revenue of $429 million, up 4% sequentially. Operating margin was 21% versus 2% in Q3 on better gross margins and operating leverage. For Q1, we expect Altera revenue to be down sequentially less than overall Intel consolidated. We continue to make good progress on the stake sale of Altera and see a path for an IPO in the coming years. Now turning to guidance. Q1 has historically been our seasonally weakest quarter of the year, down high single to low double digits percentage sequentially on average. In addition, we see added pressure coming from macro uncertainty especially around tariffs, balancing of PC inventory and increasing competition. These mitigating factors support a more-tempered revenue outlook as we come into the new year. As a result, we are forecasting a revenue range of $11.7 billion to $12.7 billion in the first quarter of 2025, down between 11% to 18% sequentially. Within Intel Products, we expect revenue to decline across all three of our segments at roughly similar rates. We expect Intel Foundry revenue roughly flat to down modestly quarter-over-quarter helped by continued mix shift to EUV wafers, Intel 18A samples and advanced packaging. At the midpoint of $12.2 billion, we expect gross margin of approximately 36%, with a tax rate of 12% and break-even EPS, all on a non-GAAP basis. Let me take a few moments to provide some commentary that may be helpful for your full-year 2025 modeling. At the consolidated level, we expect gross margin to improve from Q1. Intel Products gross margin was 51% in 2024 and is expected to decline this year due to product mix in both CCG and DCAI. Intel Foundry gross margin will improve on EUV mix shift and growth in advanced packaging despite expected depreciation growth in 2025 of roughly 10%. We continue to target 2025 OpEx of $17.5 billion with further reductions in 2026. We expect non-controlled income, or NCI, to net to roughly zero in Q1 and be in a range $500 million to $700 million impact this year, on a GAAP basis. NCI is expected to grow in fiscal year 2026 to a range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion, on a GAAP basis, and increase further in future years, as we increase wafer outs at our fabs where we have agreements with SCIP partners. We anticipate that our 2025 gross capital investments will be approximately $20 billion and at the low end of our previous guide of $20 billion to $23 billion, reflecting further capacity adjustments to Ohio and Ireland, as well as better utilization of what we call our construction-in-progress. Specifically, we invested ahead of demand over the past few years and these capital investments will enable us to meet expected demand at a lower level of spending, as we drive to more efficiently deploy our capital. We expect 2025 net CapEx of $8 billion to $11 billion with roughly half of the offsets expected to come from government incentives and tax credits and half from partner contributions. De-levering in 2025 remains a top priority for us on lower CapEx, increased cash from operations and value unlock across our non-core assets. Finally, I’ll remind you that we will provide new segment reporting in conjunction with our Q1 earnings. We expect to make further changes to our segments, including moving the edge portion of NEX into CCG, and our auto business from All Other into CCG. In addition, we expect to move the networking portion of NEX, which includes Xeon sales, into DCAI, and the IMS equipment business out of Intel Foundry into All Other. I’ll wrap up by saying that Q4 was a solid quarter to close out a challenging year. With that said, our profitability is below where it needs to be, and we must enhance our competitive position in the market. Michelle and I will continue taking actions to improve the operational and financial trajectory of the business. We will remain focused on building a stronger Intel Products business and becoming a more efficient Intel Foundry. And by driving continued progress in these areas, we are confident in our ability to unlock value for all our stakeholders. Before we open the line to questions, it’s worth mentioning that the board remains intensely focused on the search for a permanent CEO. The search is progressing, but we have nothing new to report and won’t be able to add additional information on this topic today. With that, I'll turn it over to John to start the Q&A.
John Pitzer: Thank you, Dave. We will now transition to the Q&A portion of our call. As a reminder, we would ask each of you to ask one question and a brief follow-up question where applicable. With that, Jonathan, can we take the first question please?
Operator: Certainly, and our first question for today comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.
Ross Seymore : Hi guys, thanks for letting me ask a question. I guess the first one would be for MJ. You talked about no quick fixes, but a lot of things to improve the road map. Specifically on the DCAI side of things. Can you talk about how much you think Granite is closing the gap. It sounds like Clearwater Forest is not mentioned nearly as much as far as a 2025 event neither from a launch or from a revenue perspective. So if there is any updates on that? And then just overall, what it's going to take? And when do you think we will be able to externally see that gap close versus competitors?
Michelle Johnston Holthaus : Sure. Thanks for the question, Ross. I look at it this way. So when I talk about no quick fixes, I think it's going to be one years to two years of consistent execution and continuing to see better products each year, really to bring our customers back to the table and be excited about Intel's road map. Granite Rapids is a good first step in doing that. It does close the gap. Our customers are excited about it, and we are starting to see the competitiveness of that product, materialize in volume. But I'm also very clear about where we stand. And so we've just got to see that continued throughout '26 when we get to Diamond Rapids, et cetera. So you also asked me about Clearwater Forest. So I really look at the data center market in kind of two buckets. We have our P-core products, which you know is Granite Rapids and then we have our E-core products which equates to Clearwater Forest. And what we've seen is that's more of a niche market, and we haven't seen volume materialize there, as fast as we expected. But as we look at Clearwater Forest, we expect that to come to market in the first half of 2026. 18A is doing just fine on its performance and yield for Granite Rapids, but it does have some complicated packaging expectations that move it to 2026. But we expect that to be a good product and continue to close the gap as well. But this is going to be a journey. It's not a destination. Ross,
John Pitzer : Ross, do you have a follow-up question?
Ross Seymore : Yes, switching over to Dave on the profitability side. Can you just walk us through some of the puts and takes on the gross margin sequentially in the first quarter? Obviously, revenues are down, but anything else? And then you mentioned that it would be the low point of the year gross margin in the first quarter. But what would be the headwinds and tailwinds as you think through 2025 as a whole on that metric? Thank you.
David Zinsner : Yes. Thanks, Ross. Okay. So for the first quarter, the biggest obvious contributor to gross margins sequentially is the revenue decline. At the midpoint, we are declining a little over $2 billion. And so that obviously on a mostly fixed cost business, that does affect it. We also did have a couple of bluebirds in Q4. One was the revenue beat, and so that actually elevated the revenue a bit. But the other was when we signed the CHIPS agreement, we were able to take some of the grant and accrue it, as kind of a benefit to cost of sales because it offset period expenses we had spent before. So we weren't sure we were going to sign it in the fourth quarter, which is why I didn't guide that in the guidance from last quarter, but obviously materializing that pushed the gross margins up for the fourth quarter. In the first quarter, I think what -- and we've kind of telegraphed this now for several quarters. Intel Products gross margins are going to be under pressure this year. Some of the parts have a higher cost, in particular Lunar Lake has a higher cost, as you know, because it is got the memory and package. And so we are basically buying that memory and turning around and selling it at the same price. So that's really weighing the margins down on Lunar Lake. So margins for products are going to be under pressure pretty much throughout this year. Then as Panther Lake comes in volume next year, more materially and in addition, the products beyond that, we will start to see some improvement in margins on Intel products. Now that was always to be offset in a lot of ways by the margins of Intel Foundry. We see more of a mix of EUV wafers. They have better pricing with a better cost. And so we will see a mix improvement throughout the year. We are also reducing our spending there in period expenses as part of our kind of overall $10 billion plus cost spending reduction. But it doesn't really show up in the first quarter. It's not until we get into the second and third quarter that we start to see that improvement show up. So those are really the bigger drivers of margins on the first quarter. It is a low point, as we talked about. The benefits are going to be really around margins improving on Intel Foundry. As the mix of EU wafers increases throughout the year, in particular, as we get Panther Lake in there in the back half of the year, and we are selling 18A wafers at a higher margin. And then next year, we have Panther Lake with more volume and all those wafers start to come back, and that becomes a really big benefit to Intel overall.
John Pitzer: Thank you, Ross. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your question please.
Stacy Rasgon : Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. First question just on the segment guide for next quarter. Why are all three product segments down equally when it sounds like you've gotten more headwinds just on the surface of PC's inventory digestion and maybe the roll-off of some of that tariff pull forward. What's going on in the data center and the NEX businesses that makes them as bad as a client into Q1?
David Zinsner : Well, broadly across all markets, and we didn't necessarily telegraph every market in terms of where we think. But I'd say broadly, we are a little bit cautious on the macro and that affects all markets. In addition, seasonality does play in most of the markets, and that does impact the first quarter as well. So I’d say, a combination of just macro uncertainty combined with kind of typical seasonality across all the businesses.
John Pitzer : Stacy, do you have a follow-up question?
Stacy Rasgon: Yes, I do. Thank you. So you also talked about increased competitiveness weighing on margins at least into Q1. So again, I presume that's a question on pricing. I guess is that right? Do you expect that to persist through the year? And how do you think about that competitiveness, potentially weighing on pricing across client and especially in the data center?
David Zinsner: Yes, okay. So our -- the co-CEOs are trying to figure out who should answer Okay, go ahead, Michelle. I think whoever wants to take it.
Michelle Johnston Holthaus : Yeah. The way I look at that is we do have increased competition as we see new market entrants particularly come in to CCG. We've got a very good product in Lunar Lake there, but as Dave talked about, the margins on that product are more pressured based on the cost of the product. But we are going to stem the market segment share decline in client, and we're going to go after winning every socket. That mirrors itself when you think about the data center market as well. As I said, Granite Rapids is a very positive step in a competitive direction, but we have to stem the tide of share loss in data center. And so we will be fighting for every socket in that business. And the way I look at it is we need to be aggressive. We need to win share, and we need to show our customers that they can win with us.
John Pitzer: Thank you, Stacy. Jonathan, can we have the next question please?
Operator: Certainly. And our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your question please.
C.J. Muse: Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question under your new co-leadership. I would be curious to hear how your strategy has potentially evolved specifically for IFS.
David Zinsner : I mean I think -- and we've talked about this over the last couple of quarters. For one, we are not looking to spend ahead of success. And so you saw our CapEx guide come down from the [$20 billon to $23 billion] (ph) range down to [$20 billion] (ph), that's in support of that strategy. We want to absolutely wow the customers. But to do that, we've got to be very careful around what we're promising them as well. So I think what you'll see a lot of is a little bit more conservatism around how we deploy capital, how we engage with customers. We want to be doing more than what we promised to every turn -- to every stakeholder, including investors, including customers, including suppliers, so what have you. That's pretty much the strategy. The main goal of building a world-class foundry, that is still in place. We feel that there absolutely is a need for another player in the leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing space. In particular, in the U.S., it aligns with the government -- the U.S. government's interest as well. So we are absolutely committed to that. It's now about being very cautious and careful around generating the best ROIC for the shareholders.
John Pitzer : C.J., do you have a follow-up question?
C.J. Muse: I do. Thanks. I guess, Dave, another question for you. I believe that three months ago, the stated goal for 2025 was to be free cash flow positive, I guess given kind of the weakness we are seeing in Q1 and uncertainty, can you kind of walk through how you are thinking about the path to turning free cash flow positive?
David Zinsner : Yes. So we are not obviously guiding beyond the first quarter. But I would just say, we did a very good job in a challenging situation in '24 around cash flow from operations by driving strong working capital improvements, and we adjusted CapEx accordingly, and that helped stem the tide. So while we were negative in '24, we were closer to zero than we should have been based on the top-line results. I'd say it is more about the same in '25. We're going to be acutely focused on cash flow from operations, really managing working capital effectively. We adjusted the CapEx down, as I talked about in relationship to a different outlook. We do expect some pretty significant offsets as well more than $10 billion of offsets, which will also help. I won't throw out a number yet for adjusted free cash flow for the year, but I would just say that it is a focus that -- where we want to improve. I would say in addition to that, we have these non-core businesses, and we see opportunity to monetize there. That will help us delever because that's a focus of us -- focus of ours in 2025. We are far along on the process of Altera. I suspect that by the time we get to earnings next quarter, we will have something to say there that will help generate some cash that we can use to delever.
John Pitzer: Thanks C.J. Jonathan, can we have the next question please?
Operator: Certainly. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.
Joseph Moore : Great. Thank you. In the prepared remarks, you made reference to the sort of tempering of expectations of Falcon Shores. Can you talk about what was behind that? And kind of what does it take for you to get competitive in that space?
Michelle Johnston Holthaus : Yes, of course, I can, Joe. I think it really comes down to taking the time over the last six weeks to actively engage with the teams, look at our road maps, look at where we are from a competitive perspective and from an execution perspective, and that really resulted in that decision. A lot of conversations with my customers, as well in regards to what they see is needed to be competitive and to deliver the right product. And so when I looked at that, obviously, we have our Gaudi product, we are learning a lot from that. But one of the things that we've learned from Gaudi is it's not enough to just deliver the silicon. We need to be able to deliver a complete rack scale solution, and that's what we are going to be able to do with Falcon -- excuse me, with Jaguar Shores. Falcon Shores will help us in that process of working on the system, networking memory all the component functions of that, but what customers really want is that full sale rack solution. And so we are able to get to that with Jaguar Shores. I think we've also seen a lot this week with DeepSeek and a lot of the excitement around not one-size fits all. And so I'm also trying to look at the road map to say there is a lot of IP and assets that we have at Intel Product co that we can leverage to address this market. We've got great CPUs, GPUs, ASICs, FPGAs, and we need to figure out how we harness those because if we've seen anything this week, when there are constraints put on customers, they figure out different ways to deploy technology. And so that's also a great opportunity and something that I'm looking at and looking at if there is ways that we can be disrupted there.
John Pitzer : Joe, do you have a follow-up question?
Joseph Moore : I do. And thank you for your candor about all of that. I think separately, you mentioned in his prepared remarks about potentially seeing tariffs driving some pull forward. Can you just talk about how pervasive that might be? Is that conservatism that, that might be happening? Are you seeing evidence that's happening? Just some color on where that's coming from.
David Zinsner : Yes. I mean, we obviously have a fairly good sense of what customers need from quarter-to-quarter. And in a couple of instances, customers ordered more than we think they were digesting. And so it was really just the analytics that gave us insight into – they are doing that for a reason, and we know tariffs are big subject of a lot of our customers. It was in the region you might expect in the Asian region that we saw this. It is hard for me to extrapolate this beyond this quarter. A lot not known yet around what might be the plans on tariffs. I just thought it was a little bit of hedging going on by customers that pulled revenue into the fourth quarter and away from the first quarter.
John Pitzer: Thank you, Joe. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question please.
Timothy Arcuri : Thanks a lot. Dave, I also wanted to ask about gross margin. I think the message you were saying is that it's kind of 60% incremental, and that was kind of off of the [39.5%] (ph) that you guided for Q4, but obviously, you came in, you had these one-timers and now we're down to March. So can you just sort of level set us for kind of how to think of the incrementals from here?
David Zinsner : Incrementals from Q -- in other words, into [Q2, Q3 and Q4] (ph). Is that what you're saying?
Timothy Arcuri : Yes. Yes. Just kind of like is it off of [39.5%] (ph), is about [ 36.5%] (ph).
David Zinsner : Yes. The rule of thumb has generally been 60% in this period of what I call catch up. Obviously, we think we can do better fall-through, as we get more stabilized. The one dynamic in '25 is this kind of margin pressure around product like Lunar Lake. That probably pulls the range down to probably something more like in the 40% to 60% fall-through is probably the right way to think about it just for that dynamic. Now we get into '26 and you start to see a lot more 18A volume through Panther Lake, I think we are in the 60%-plus range at that level.
John Pitzer : Tim, do you have a follow-up question?
Timothy Arcuri : I do. Yes, Dave, also, so you took the CapEx to the low end, but there's $1.2 billion outflow that's in the financing section of the cash flow statement. What is that? I guess I'm trying to figure out just on an apples-to-apples basis, is like CapEx really coming down this year? And is that a line item in the financing section, is that going to keep getting bigger this year? Thanks.
David Zinsner : Yes. No -- let's see, let me go back on the CapEx. If you look at CapEx for '25, the $20 billion forecast, what's driving that lower is really a function of better utilizing assets under construction. So our philosophy has been to invest kind of ahead of what was required, and we built up a pretty significant balance in assets under construction, I mean, to the tune of greater than $50 billion. So we actually have a lot of capital on the balance sheet that really hasn't been deployed. And so what we pushed the teams to do in an effort to drive better ROA and return on invested capital is to have them digest as much as that as possible and limit the amount of purchases that we make externally. And that's going to allow us to get down to the $20 billion range. I would be – we are not doing any funky financing around this, but I would be in the spirit of transparency, say that CapEx is two things, right? It's what you place in terms of orders on equipment, and it's when you give them the cash. And so for sure, we are working the payment terms of suppliers to improve our -- to improve our CapEx, lower our CapEx, that is pushing spend out even as we are getting the assets in. But quite honestly, by the time we've actually deployed it and it's depreciating, we've actually, in all cases, I think, spent the money because it goes on to assets under construction and probably hangs in there for like nine months before it's ever deployed.
John Pitzer: Thank you, Tim. Jonathan, do we have the next question?
Operator: Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Your question please.
Vivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. First kind of related questions are on the data center server CPU market. M.J. I'm curious, when you look at Intel versus your x86 competitor, do you think these share gains are because of better design or access to better manufacturing? And so what can be fixed and what will take time to fix or if you were to outsource more, right to external foundry does that help you regain share, and I imagine that applies more to cloud. And then on the enterprise side, have you seen any share shifts at all over the last few years?
Michelle Johnston Holthaus : Thanks, Vivek. Well, as you look at data center and the competitiveness, as I said and stated earlier, Granite Rapids did a good job of making a good first step in closing the gap versus competition, but we still have a gap. And so we've got to be laser focused next on delivering Diamond Rapids. And the feedback for both of those products early is very positive. When it comes to external manufacturing, I've been pretty transparent about this in the way I think about it in my philosophy. The way I look at it is you have to have the right product at the right process and you have to deliver that within the right market window. If you look at Intel's overall today, we do about 30% of our manufacturing externally across a variety of partners. That's probably the high for where we are today, but it will never be 0%. What I can tell you is 18A is going well. They earn my business, obviously both for Panther Lake and for Clearwater Forest. But as I think about being more competitive in data center moving forward and I look at future designs, I will ask myself that question every time, as we look at the road map. So I think it would not be unfathomable that I would put a data center product outside. If that meant that I hit the right product, the right market window, as well as the right performance for my customers.
John Pitzer : Vivek, Do you have a follow-up question?
Vivek Arya : Yes. Thank you, John. So maybe one for Dave on this non-controlling interest. I think David said $500 million to $700 million for this year, so a little bit lower than I think the $700 million you had before. But then it starts to grow to $1.2 billion or $1.4 billion. Is this always going to keep on increasing, right? Like what is the right way for us to model it because the less you outsource -- I guess the more you insource, the more you give to Intel Foundry, the more reversals, right, you have to do on this NCI part, I would imagine. So is it a reasonable way to model how much of a headwind this is to your reported EPS?
David Zinsner : Yes, it is a good question. I mean, just to break it all out, it is more than just the SCIPs. SCIP 1 and 2, are obviously in there, but also Mobileye shows up in noncontrolling interest. And as we sell down stakes in companies like Mobileye and Altera, it actually exacerbates that NCI. So Altera doesn't have any NCI, but as soon as we sell a stake, it is going to have NCI. So there are a number of things that go into it, which makes it a little bit difficult to forecast because you have to kind of know -- you have to know two things with certainty, one, exactly what share of every asset you have? And two, what your production is going to look like in the fabs that you have these SCIPs. So what we felt comfortable was, was guiding '25 and giving you an indication for '26, it's likely to go up in '27. But I think it is probably too soon to actually identify what the exact number will look like.
John Pitzer: Thanks Vivek. Jonathan, can we have the next question please?
Operator: Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes from Melius. Your question please.
Ben Reitzes : Hi guys. Thanks a lot for the question. Dave and MJ, I wanted to -- I know in your prepared remarks, you said you look forward to working with the Trump administration. I was wondering if you could just give a little more detail about your initial talks with them. Have they reached out? And who's like leading the discussions from your side? And any color on what you're exactly talking about and what they're particularly interested in? I mean Howard Lutnick, obviously, it sounds like this is very near and dear to him during his confirmation hearings and would love to just kind of get a little bit more color on where you -- what you have done so far and where you think it's going? And then I'll have a follow-up. Thanks so much guys.
David Zinsner : Yes. Okay. Thanks, Ben. Maybe I'll take that as the co-CEO. yes, we have good engagement with them. We've really been engaged since the election, with the team at various levels, obviously, at the CEO level, but also we have a strong government affairs team that engages with them every day. I feel really good about their outlook on bringing semiconductor manufacturing back to the U.S. I think this is a very positive sign, obviously, for us. Quite honestly, we never left the U.S. So we are in a kind of the pull position in that regard. And I think they understand the value of doing R&D in the U.S. for advanced semiconductor manufacturing, which also is positive. They want to see more jobs coming back to the U.S. We pay high wage, high tech jobs. So that's obviously positive for them. But more importantly, this is about security, both in terms of just the supply chain but also in kind of secure manufacturing for the Department of Defense, which we are obviously in a position to do for them. I imagine that as we progress, we will be more engaged with them to make this a reality. And both Michelle and I will be meeting fairly regularly with the Trump administration officials to go make their goals or reality for the U.S.
John Pitzer : Ben, you said you had a follow-up?
Ben Reitzes : Yeah, thanks. I wanted to double-click on a prior question on gross margins and ask it a little bit more in caveman terms rather than incremental. You talked about 1Q being the bottom. I'm trying to figure out how high it goes sequentially, as we go throughout the year, given -- it sounds like you're going to be a lot more price aggressive in server CPUs and client CPUs from what I heard. So in addition to -- I'm trying to balance that with the thought of outsourcing more to TSMC for the year, et cetera. So if that's the low point. I guess what I'm trying to say, can you be more prescriptive in light of that pricing comment I made and if it's right, then just give us a little more color on where we go from the 1Q, that would be great. Thank you.
David Zinsner : Yes, I mean, we tend to be competitive in the product space. And also, as I mentioned, the cost structure is under some pressure, in particular because of Lunar Lake. So that absolutely will impact the gross margins on products. There won't be a lot of lift in that business unit through the year. And it is really not until Panther Lake comes that they, I think, start to see some better cost structure and have a part that's very competitive that I think allows us to perhaps even relax some of that pressure in a competitive market. That said, the Foundry business will see improvements. Over the course of the year, more wafers will be coming back. With Panther Lake, it becomes even better in the following year. We are improving the cost structure of the foundry business as part of our overall spending reduction plan. So that will also help. And then just keep in mind, these wafers that we are producing at Intel and 18A have much better cost structure and margin structure relative, I should say, relative to the price structure than their predecessors and that will be beneficial on the Foundry side. So in the caveman macro sense, I think the best thing to do is probably take this like somewhere in the 40% to 60% fall-through and that's probably the right rough order math to get you to where the margins will go in any quarter based on what you're projecting the revenue to be in that quarter.
John Pitzer: Thanks Ben. Jonathan, can we have the next question please?
Operator: Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your question please.
Aaron Rakers : Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I want to build off of that last question a little bit. During the prepared remarks, you had mentioned 1% in 2023 with EUV wafer mix and that progressed to north of 5% this year. Can you give us a framework of how you would define success looking through 2025, maybe exiting the year as far as EUV wafer mix? And remind us again what the delta is in terms of cost structure, the margin dynamics of an EUV wafer.
David Zinsner : Yes. Well, I'll say on the second part, maybe I'll answer that one first. I would say the price on those wafers goes up at 3 times the cost of those -- sorry, maybe said -- the blended ASP and cost goes up 3 times, as you go to 18A versus the cost. So it's a pretty dramatic improvement in gross margins as you move into 18A versus pre-EUV wafers. Probably, it would be tough for me to hazard a guess on exactly how we'll exit the year in terms of our percentage of EUV. It's definitely going to go up. Granite is on Intel3, Panther Lake is on -- Meteor Lake is on Intel3 or 4 – called the 4 three way node; panther Lake is on 18A this year. So we'll see a pretty meaningful jump in the percentage of wafers that will be EUV, as we exit '25.
Ross Seymore : Aaron, do we have a follow-up question?
Aaron Rakers : I do, and it's probably a dumb question, but I'm just going to ask it because I'm just a little confused that the SCIP impact, this $500 million to $700 million going to $1.2 billion. Just remind us again, though we are all clear that when you report EPS on a non-GAAP basis, that's in that EPS number, just so we -- I'm modeling it correctly. I'm sure my peers are already, but I want to make sure I've got that all clear in my head.
David Zinsner : I just want to be clear. It's not just SCIP. I mean that includes the Mobileye income and will include the Altera income to some extent. But yes, all of that in the NCI, we do take it against our non-GAAP number to get our fully diluted non-GAAP EPS number.
John Pitzer : Thank you. Jonathan, we have time for one more question.
Operator: Certainly. And our final question for today comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from Raymond James. Your question please.
Srini Pajjuri : Thank you. Thanks for squeezing me in. Dave, on the foundry breakeven, I guess target for 2027. Maybe can you talk about what are the assumptions behind that? I mean do you think you can get there with mostly internal wafers? Or do you need external customers as well? If so, what sort of revenue do we need from external customers to, I guess, achieve that breakeven?
David Zinsner : Yes. So we are still aiming to get to breakeven in 2017, as you pointed out. It is really on the back of internal wafers or wafers from Intel products, I should say. And it's obviously, a lot based on EUV wafers, which carry a better margin. And as that mix improves, that significantly improves the margins. But more importantly, I think the original premise by creating this different P&L structure was to drive the foundry business really at that point was just a function of manufacturing to be more focused on efficiency, to squeeze out more from the existing footprint, to be more sensitive to capital and ultimately, just think about ROIC in everything they do, and I think that has worked actually. I mean I hear it all the time, it is amazing the transformation we've seen in staff meetings and Michelle and I that attend that, they are completely pivoted to how to make money in that business. And so I think it is working. I think we'll see significantly more efficiency as we go into work through '25 and into '26. So I feel good about our ability to get to breakeven. Obviously, we want to have external customers. And so we have some very small amount that we've assumed for '27. But if 18A looks like it's something that hunts based on feedback from customers. And I feel like we will probably outperform in that regard in terms of the mix of external customers versus internal customers. So those are all the factors that I think will drive '27 to profitability. And ultimately, obviously, we want to get to push -- to breakeven and ultimately we want to get the business to a profitable level that's consistent with what the Foundry industry gets.
John Pitzer : Srini, do you have a quick follow-on?
Srini Pajjuri : Yes. A quick one. So on the 18A Panther Lake, I think in the past, I think, Dave the comment was that you expect to bring roughly 70% of the die in-house. Is that still the plan? And then is it pretty set in stone that you are bringing it back for sure? Or do you have any flexibility whether to bring back more of the die or less of the die if you need to. So just trying to understand.
David Zinsner : I'm going to let Michelle answer that because it really is her decision on how she builds her products.
Michelle Johnston Holthaus : Yes. So we did move Panther Lake inside of 18A design win. But as I stated before, we look at each generation of products based on what's the right product, what's the right process, what's the right market window and what allows our customers to win. So for Panther Lake, that was 18A. And as I said, we are very happy with where we are from a performance and yield perspective at this point in the process. So that will stay on 18A. Then as you look forward, to our next-generation product for client after that, Nova Lake will actually have die both inside and outside for that process. So you'll actually see compute tiles inside and outside. Again, it's about optimizing to what allows us to win in the market, what allows us to win with our customers and optimizing the overall product portfolio because at the end of the day, if our customers are successful, we win, that drives more wafers and Intel Foundry and that allows us to win. But I'll continue to have a balance. And as I said, we will be doing the same look across our data center portfolio as well.
David Zinsner : Great. Thanks, Michelle. So with that, let me wrap up by saying thank you, as always for joining the call. MJ and I appreciate the opportunity to discuss our progress and the actions we've taken. Q4 was a good step forward, obviously but we have a lot of hard work ahead of us, and we are looking forward to updating you as we go along. We hope to see many of you in person at the investors conferences we'll be attending in Q1. And I would also like to highlight that the Intel Foundry team will be hosting their second annual Direct Connect User event on April 29 in San Jose, and we hope many of you will join that in person. So thank you, and good night.
Michelle Johnston Holthaus : Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",2025-01-30
INTC,2025,1,2025-Q1-INTC,"Operator: Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Intel Corporation First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question and answer session. To ask a question during this session, you'll need to press star 11 on your telephone. If your question has been answered and you'd like to remove yourself from the queue, simply press star 11 again. As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, John Pitzer, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
John Pitzer: Thank you, Jonathan, and good afternoon to everyone joining us today. By now, you should have received a copy of the Q1 earnings release and earnings presentation, both of which are available on our Investor Relations website, intc.com. For those joining us online today, the earnings presentation is also available in our webcast window. I'm joined today by our CEO, Lip Bu Tan, and our CFO, David Zinsner. Lip Bu will open with comments on our first quarter results as well as some initial observations, priorities, and actions that he is driving. Dave will then discuss our overall financial results, including second quarter guidance. We will then transition to answer your questions. Before we begin, please note that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such, are subject to various risks and uncertainties. It also contains references to non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information to our investors. Our earnings release and most recent annual report on Form 10-Ks and other filings with the SEC provide more information on specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. They also provide additional information on our non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations where appropriate to our corresponding GAAP financial measures. With that, let me turn things over to Lip Bu.
Lip Bu Tan: Thank you, John. And let me add my welcome. I joined Intel Corporation five weeks ago. The reason I'm here is simple. I love our company. I saw the challenges we were facing and I could not sit on the sidelines knowing I had the opportunity to turn things around and put us back on the path to gain market share and drive sustainable growth. Q1 was a step in the right direction. Driven by Dave and Michelle's leadership, we delivered revenue, gross margins, and EPS above our guidance. I want to thank them both as well as our teams for the good execution, especially with the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. Our goal now is to build on this progress. But it won't be easy. There are many areas we need to improve, and there's no quick fixes. We must remain laser-focused on execution. One of my biggest learnings so far is that we need to fundamentally transform our culture and the way in which we operate. Organizational complexity and bureaucracies have been suffocating the innovation and agility we need to win. It takes too long for decisions to get made. New ideas and people who generate them have not been given the room or resources to incubate and grow. The unnecessary silos have led to bad execution. I'm here to fix this. I'm taking shift actions to simplify the way we do business and drive transparency and accountability across the company. We will empower smaller teams to move faster and make better decisions, and we will significantly reduce the number of layers that get in their way. As a first step, I have flattened the structure of my leadership team. All critical product, manufacturing, and GNA functions, which were spread over two to three layers, are now directly reporting to me. This will allow me to get closer to our product and engineering groups and work directly with them to close the gaps with competition more quickly. I will apply the same streamlining approach across the company with a focus on empowering our engineering talents to create great products and make it easier for our customers to do business with us. To accelerate this simplification, we are taking more cost out of the business. The lower our calendar 2025 and calendar 2026 OpEx targets. We now expect OpEx of $17 billion this year and $16 billion next year. In addition, as we continue to identify ways to operate our manufacturing network more efficiently, I have directed our teams to find an additional $2 billion of savings in our gross CapEx, taking our target for this year to $18 billion. We will continue to take a closer look at our existing factory footprint to ensure that we are making the most efficient use of our installed capacity before committing to any additional spending. I will continue to make the needed investment to reignite innovation even as we reduce our overall expenses by minimizing projects and programs that have been taking attention away from our core client and server business. They will include revitalizing our engineering core and rebuilding our engineering talent pool with urgency by promoting strong leaders internally, bringing back critical lost talent, and recruiting new people. In addition, we are mandating a four-day-per-week return to office policy effective Q3 2025. I know firsthand the power of teamwork, and this action is necessary to reinstill a more collaborative working environment, improving efficiency, and boosting innovation. By eliminating inefficiencies and transforming how we do business, I strongly believe we can reduce our cost while securing our future. Many of you have asked about my longer-term strategic plan. It is an appropriate question. It's a little bit too soon for me to provide all the details, but let me share with you my priorities. First, the best products always win. And this is very important that we refocus our core franchise to start building best-in-class products again. We have a good foundation. Our ecosystem in client and data center is valuable and durable, and we still maintain a large market share in both. My focus will be ensuring that our team builds products that are highly competitive and meet the needs of our customers as we enter a new era of computing defined by AI agents and reasoning models. To achieve this, we are taking a holistic approach to redefine our portfolio to optimize our products for new and emerging AI workloads. We are making necessary adjustments to our product roadmap so that we are positioned to make the best-in-class products while staying laser-focused on execution and ensuring on-time delivery. However, I want to emphasize that this is not a quick fix here. These changes will take time. Our goal is to become the platform of choice for our customers. This requires us to radically evolve our design and engineering mindset and anticipate the needs of our customers well in advance. I have received direct feedback from many of our largest customers, who are also close personal friends. I'm taking this feedback to heart and using it to inform and change our approach to product and platform design. Second, we need to refine our AI strategy with a focus on emerging areas of interest. My experience helping successfully fund and incubate many startups in this space provides unique insights that we will leverage in these funds. Our goal will be to take our integrated system and platform view to develop full-stack AI solutions that enable more accuracy, power efficiency, and security for our enterprise customers. Our goal will be to enable the next wave of computing defined by reasoning models, AgenTiC AI, and physical AI. Third, we need to build trust with foundry customers. We have a lot of important building blocks in place, including the RAM of Intel 18A in February to support the launch of our first Pantheon Lake SKU by year-end, with additional SKUs coming in February. However, I know from my years at Cadence Design that success in the foundry business requires more than process technology manufacturing capabilities alone. It is first and foremost a customer service business built on the foundational principle of trust. And we need to instill a customer service mindset across our foundry business. Success in foundry relies on recognizing that each customer uses different design tools, methodologies, and styles. As a foundry, we need to ensure that our process technologies can be easily used by a variety of customers, each with a unique way of building their products. To do this, we are more rapidly embracing industry-standard EDA tools and best design practices. Here again, there's no quick fix, but we will make the necessary changes to our roadmap to deliver on the commitments we make to our foundry customers. We must learn to delight our customers by building wafers that meet their required power, performance, area, cost, quality, yield, reliability, and on-time schedule. While we are currently focused on delivering Intel 18A, we are also working closely with customers to define the critical KPIs to ensure online delivery of Intel 14A. Lastly, we need to strengthen our balance sheet. Our business is capital-intensive, and we have important investments to make at a time when our financial performance is not where it needs to be. This means we need to be prudent with capital. In addition to new targets of OpEx, CapEx, we will also look to further monetize non-core assets. I'm very pleased to have Silver Lake as an investor in Altera and welcome on board Rakib to help drive the business to its potential. In addition, we have made the decision not to spin off Intel Capital but to work with the team to monetize our existing portfolio while being more selective on new investments that support our strategy. We need to get our balance sheet healthy and start the process of deleveraging this year. As we are building the new Intel, you can expect us to stay humble, drive the necessary changes, to delight our customers. MicroMoto has always been to under-promise and over-deliver, and I will not be satisfied until we regain the trust of our customers, putting the company on a sustainable path of gaining shares and growing revenue, and delivering consistent returns for our shareholders. With that, I will turn it over to Dave.
David Zinsner: Thank you, Lip Bu. Our Q1 results mostly reflected our view entering the year that our two biggest markets were poised for growth. On the client side, the end of service for Windows 10, the expected growing adoption of AIPCs, and an aging installed base following the COVID era refresh pointed to a PC TAM growing 3% to 5%. Similarly, on the traditional server side, delayed infrastructure upgrades driven by the rapid adoption of AI servers in 2024 supported double-digit CPU core growth this year on a roughly flat unit. More recently, the economic landscape has become increasingly uncertain, driven by shifting trade policies, persistent inflation, and increased regulatory risk. While we have yet to see a meaningful change in customer buying patterns, we think it prudent to manage the business with a level of conservatism going into the second half of the year. First-quarter revenue was $12.7 billion, coming in at the high end of our guidance range, driven by better-than-expected Xeon sales. Similar to Q4 2024, we believe Q1 revenue benefited from customer purchasing behavior anticipation of potential tariffs, it is difficult to quantify the magnitude. Non-GAAP gross margin was 39.2%, approximately three percentage points above our guidance on much stronger-than-expected demand for Raptor Lake combined with improved cost for Meteor Lake. While we continue to see the mix of AIPCs growing throughout the year, the rate of growth off a lower-than-expected Q1 will be lower. We delivered first-quarter earnings per share of 13¢ versus our guidance of breakeven EPS driven by higher revenue, stronger gross margin, and lower operating expenses. I was particularly pleased to see our spending down $400 million sequentially and $700 million year over year as we continue to focus on optimizing our cost structure. Q1 operating cash flow was $800 million. We had growth CapEx of $6.2 billion with offsets of $1.7 billion in the quarter, resulting in an adjusted free cash flow of negative $3.7 billion. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $21 billion and received $1.1 billion from CHIPS grants, and $1.9 billion for the final close of our NAND business sale to SK Inox. Moving to segment results for Q1. As previewed on our Q4 2024 earnings, we updated our segment reporting for Q1 2025. Details can be found in the appendix to our earnings deck and in our Q1 2025 10-Q. The following commentary reflects the updated segmentation and accompanying recasted 2024 financials. Intel products revenue was $11.8 billion, down 10% sequentially but above our expectations. CCG revenue was down 13% quarter over quarter, below typical seasonality and in line with our expectation with higher-than-expected volumes, offset by product mix and competitive pressure. DCAI revenue was down 5% sequentially and above expectations driven by hyperscaler demand for host CPUs for AI servers and storage compute. Operating profit for Intel products was $2.9 billion, 25% of revenue, and down $632 million quarter over quarter on lower revenue, partially offset by reduced operating expenses. Intel Foundry delivered revenue of $4.7 billion, up 8% sequentially on pull-ins of Intel seven wafers and increased advanced packaging services. Intel foundry operating loss in Q1 was $2.3 billion, roughly flat quarter over quarter and in line with expectations. Structural cost improvements were offset by startup costs associated with the ramp of products on Intel 18. Turning to all other, revenue came in at $943 million, and was down 15% sequentially, slightly above expectations. The three primary components of all other are Mobileye, Altera, and IMS. Collectively, the category delivered $103 million of operating profit. As Lip Bu stated, we announced on April 14 our intention to sell 51% of Altera to Silver Lake Partners for an almost $9 billion valuation, Intel receiving net cash proceeds of $4.4 billion. We believe the value of our remaining 49% stake in Altera will grow over time through our partnership with Silver Lake, and with the addition of Raghav Hussein as the CEO. We expect this deal to close in the second half of 2025, at which point we expect to deconsolidate Altera from our financial results. Now turning to guidance. Historically, average sequential growth in Q2 has been roughly flat with Q1. However, the very fluid trade policies in the US and beyond as well as regulatory risks have increased the chance of an economic slowdown with the probability of a recession growing. This makes it more difficult to forecast how we will perform for the quarter and for the year even as the underlying fundamentals supporting growth I discussed earlier remain intact. While we have offsets including a global highly diversified manufacturing footprint to help mitigate tariffs, we will certainly see costs increase, and we feel it prudent to anticipate a TAM contraction. The biggest risk we see is the impact of a potential pullback in investment and spending as businesses and consumers react to higher costs and the uncertain economic backdrop. As a result, we're forecasting a wider than normal Q2 revenue range of $11.2 to $12.4 billion, down 2% to 12% sequentially. Within Intel products, we expect DCAI to decline at a faster rate than CCG. We expect Intel foundry revenue down quarter over quarter due to pull-ins to Q1, lower wafer and advanced packaging volume, and capacity constraints in Intel seven, which we expect to persist for the foreseeable future. For all other, expect revenue for the sum of those parts to be roughly flat sequentially. At the midpoint of $11.8 billion, we expect a gross margin of approximately 36.5% on lower revenue and mix to our outsourced and lower margin client products with a tax rate of 12% and breakeven EPS all on a non-GAAP basis. As you think about the full year, we recommend you start by using the last ten-year seasonality to model sequential changes in revenue. But be mindful of the significant uncertainty in the market today, especially due to the potential for meaningful tariffs and tight supply on our older nodes. We expect non-controlled income or NCI to net to zero in Q2, and for the full year to be approximately $500 million on a GAAP basis. NCI is still expected to grow in fiscal year 2026, to an updated range of $1.3 to $15 billion on a GAAP basis and meaningfully increase further in future years. As Lip Bu discussed earlier, we're simplifying our organizational structure and the way we work across Intel so that we innovate faster and adapt more quickly where needed to better serve our customers. As a result, we now expect 2025 OpEx of $17 billion, $500 million lower than prior expectations with a 2026 OpEx target of $16 billion. We are likely to have restructuring charges associated with these actions, some of which may be included in our non-GAAP results. Since we have not yet estimated these charges, they are not included in our guidance. These spending reductions will be driven by numerous broad-based transformation activities. Key 2025 focus areas will be refocusing our portfolio, eliminating organizational complexity, transforming our engineering functions, and continuing to drive to leading SG and A efficiency. As Lip Bu stated, we anticipate our 2025 gross capital investment will now be approximately $18 billion, which is below our previous guide of $20 billion, reflecting further operational efficiencies, and better utilization of our construction in progress. While gross CapEx is down, we maintain our range for 2025 net CapEx to be approximately $8 to $11 billion due to uncertainty regarding the timing of the US government fulfilling their obligations in our CHIPS agreement. Beginning the process of delevering our balance sheet in 2025 remains a top priority for us, as evidenced by our lower OpEx and CapEx targets and the value unlock across our non-core assets. I'll wrap up by saying that Q1 was a solid quarter to start even as the rest of the year is more uncertain. We will closely manage what's in our control and react quickly as the environment evolves. I'm encouraged by Lip Bu's leadership and on enhancing our competitive position, improving our balance sheet, setting us on a path to deliver consistent returns to our shareholders. With that, let me turn the call back over to John to begin the Q&A.
John Pitzer: Thank you, Dave. We will now transition to the Q&A portion of our call. Michelle Johnston Holthaus, CEO of Intel products, will be joining Lip Bu and Dave during the Q&A session. As a reminder, we would ask that each of you ask one question and a brief question where applicable. With that, Jonathan, can we take the first question, please?
Operator: Certainly. And our first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.
Ross Seymore: Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Lip Bu, welcome to Intel. Lip Bu, the first question is for you. You talked a lot about increasing the flexibility and speed at Intel and, you know, unfortunately, having to shrink the headcount to do so. How do we balance fixing the roadmap with also filling the foundry and making sure you have the unit volumes there? It seems like the flexibility and speed goals would be more quickly adopted and capitalized by going to foundry. But you have the need to fill your own Intel. So balancing the internal product roadmap versus the Foundry side of things is basically the question.
Lip Bu Tan: Yeah. Ross, thank you so much for the questions. So a couple of things. One is clearly the approach is basically to flatten the organization, to the number of layers, and so that we can really focus on the right products and then deliver the customer the solution. And then in some of the product and the roadmap, I think it clearly we like to focus on what is the killing product that we want to have. And a laser focus on making sure that we deliver on time on the performance and then the, you know, the power so that make sure that we meet the customer requirement. And then in terms of the foundry, clearly, you know, AT and A is very important for us. For Pentelic. And, you know, secondly, I think we clearly one by one, improving the yield, the reliability, and so that our internal customer can use that. I think from the product side, they have to do the best they can now depend on whether it's inside or outside. And then drive the performance of the products.
John Pitzer: Ross, do you have a follow-up question?
Ross Seymore: Yeah. I did have one for Dave. Dave, the gross margin side of things, you talked a little bit about the slope for the rest of the year. But especially given the strategic changes that Lip Bu is putting into place, the cost-cutting and the OpEx side of things, and the lower CapEx that you talked about. Can you just talk about some of the puts and takes on gross margin if you think about 2025 as a whole and maybe even 2026? What are some of the goals that you have?
David Zinsner: Yeah. Sure, Ross. And I'll qualify this by saying, you know, it's a relatively dynamic industry out there right now given the tariffs and the implications on what that might look like from our TAM and from the macro. So I'm saying this with, you know, some murkiness as it relates to the full-year picture. I would just say that when we look out through the year, we do expect to see our mix on the client side move more to, you know, the Lunar Lake and so forth. And as you know, Lunar Lake's margins are more under pressure given the memories and package, and so that makes, you know, the accounting look make it look a little funky. So that will be a headwind to our margins on a go-forward basis. And in addition, when we look at 18A, we're going to be ramping that through the year. There's startup costs associated with that bringing that up in Arizona. So that's always gonna put some pressure on gross margins through the year as well. I think as you get into '26, things start to go the other direction, you know, Panther Lake will be ramping more in volume next year. It's a better margin product than Lunar Lake just on the, you know, on an apples-to-apples basis, but on top of that, you know, as you know, we have 18A, on Panther Lake, so it brings the wafers back into the fabs, and we get the margin stacking benefit of that on a kind of consolidated basis. So we, you know, we'd expect next year to look better. Of course, all of that is, you know, subject ultimately a lot of what is reflected in the margins is how we do on the top line side, and so, you know, we gotta sort through, you know, how tariffs impact us. You know, I think from a tariff perspective, you know, this year could be choppy depending on what ultimately is settled across the US and abroad. But we do have a global supply chain. So we do have the ability to flex to mitigate a lot of the headwinds we face. It's just we can't, you know, obviously turn this stuff on a dime. It's gonna take us time to, you know, optimize the network to what the rules are, you know, in terms of tariffs.
John Pitzer: Thank you. Thanks, Ross. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator: Certainly. And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question, please.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. Dave, can you help us just also on gross margin? Can you help us with sort of what a clean number is for March? You guided 36%, but that was supposed to have some COGS headwinds from the way you accounted for the grants, but it came in at 39. So sort of what's the clean number for March? And then also, you said that the Q1 number would be the trough. So you know, I know you're guiding Q2 to thirty-six five, but it, like, is could it go lower than what you're guiding?
David Zinsner: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, obviously, we thought Q1 would be a trough, and it turned out to be better. So that, you know, that put some pressure on 2Q now on a relative basis. And like I said, you know, this the tariff dynamics do kind of change the outlook through the year so that's that's an additional pressure point for gross margins through the year. In terms of the margins for Q1, you know, cleaning that out, clearly, the biggest benefit to the gross margins was the beat on the top line. We, you know, kind of handedly beat the top line. That helped out a lot. In addition, we did better or we had more of our volume come from Raptor Lake versus Lunar Lake. And so that was mix beneficial to gross margins. And, you know, and then we did, I think, a little bit better job in terms of just managing spending. And so forth that that helped out. But the two bigger components were the higher revenue in Raptor Lake. I think if you strip those two things out, we were we would've been much closer to the guide.
John Pitzer: Tim, do you have a follow-up?
Timothy Arcuri: I do. Yeah. So, Lip Bu, I know the prior policy had been to not announce new, you know, third-party foundry customers. How do you think about that? And how can you update us on sort of what you're tracking? Is there anything to help believe that maybe you can add a tier-one customer and maybe this year, you know, if not sooner, I know that they want, you know, want some power improvements on AT and A. But can you kinda talk about that? Thank you.
Lip Bu Tan: Sure. Thanks, Tim. I think the priority one for us is for Intel Foundry is ramping our internal customer. Like the Pentelic I mentioned earlier. And then the next step is basically building the trust with our foundry customer and, you know, the PDK, the schedule, you know, to really make sure that we're really robust on that. And then in terms of the process technology, the priority is really focused on yield reliability, and also I think it's very important to understand this is a customer service mindset so that, you know, customers have different design tools, methodology styles, want to make sure that we really do the pattern matching so that we really optimize for their solution they want to drive. So I think it's kind of one, two steps, and then we'd really continue to drive the efficiency and then so that we can really scale the business.
John Pitzer: Thank you, Tim. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?
Operator: Certainly. And our next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.
Joseph Moore: Great. Thank you. So a number of elements in your letter and in your comments about kind of improving product execution. Guess five weeks into it, can you give us your assessment of Panther Lake and Clearwater Forest in the 1880? Alright. Portfolio and give us a sense of, you know, are those leadership products? Do you still have work to do to get to the leadership position that you wanna have?
Lip Bu Tan: Yeah. Let me start. I think Michelle will chip in. First of all, I think clearly our laser focus on execution. And in terms of delivering on time, a performance that we can meet the customer and industry trends. And the workload. So that is the number one priority for us. In terms of Panther Lake, you know, clearly on the 18A is very important. We have the first SKU by the end of this year, then we have additional SKU the next year. So I think so far we are very focused on that. Michelle?
Michelle Johnston Holthaus: Yeah. Maybe just to add, Joe, I think I talked about this a little bit in our Q4 earnings. Panther Lake really matches what you see in both Meteor Lake and Lunar the way that we're gonna ramp, bringing our first most performant product out first with customers and then the additional SKUs in Q1, which really allows us to line up with the commercial marketplace. That product looks quite good competitively, and we get a lot of customer interest, so I think we continue to track well there. You also asked about Clearwater Forest, and I talked a bit about that and the prioritization between Panther Lake and Clearwater Forest in Q4 as well. And so for Clearwater Forest, it has some very unique packaging that comes to market with it, and therefore, we decided to prioritize getting Panther Lake out first. And then the first half of 2026, you'll see Clearwater Forest. I would just remind you that Clearwater Forest is an ECORE based product, so it's a derivative. Right, of Granite Rapids. And so it'll be, you know, a more of a purpose-built product than your kind of leading performance part. In the marketplace, but both are on track for delivery.
John Pitzer: Joe, do you have a follow-up question?
Joseph Moore: I do. Thank you for that. The comment that you guys made about seven nanometer being constrained for the foreseeable future. Can you elaborate on why that is and what impact that might have?
David Zinsner: Yeah. Oh, pretty simply, you know, we're doing better on Raptor Lake and Raptor Lake's an Intel seven part. And so, you know, we obviously plan out our network to be, you know, just to the edge in terms of, you know, capacity and, you know, when things shift meaningfully like they did, you know, we're gonna be hand them out. That said, you know, that's usually a good thing for the factory. When they're constrained, they, you know, leverage, the network to try to, you know, produce more wafers, and every wafer becomes less expensive as a result. So, you know, we do we obviously do like that. Ultimately, though, we do wanna see these AIPC products gain more traction in the market, and we're optimistic that happens in the year.
Michelle Johnston Holthaus: Yeah. Maybe just to add on both seven and ten nanometer. Obviously, with the macroeconomic concerns that we see and just with the overall economy, we are particularly seeing consumer a stronger n minus one and n minus two demand in the market as those system price points tend to stay rather fixed. And so we've been doing our best to respond to that shift while at the same time in the commercial segment, we are seeing that Windows 10 refresh and a strong demand for AIPC. Think there's both good and bad news in that in that as you see n minus one, n minus two, as Dave talked about, you see a lot of that gross margin flow to the bottom line. It is also, you know, as the AIPC ramp slows, that's also good for gross margins. But I do want you to walk away with the fact that we continue to invest in the AIPC. We do view this as the long-term growth segment. We have our AI symposium with all the software vendors this week, and we see a ton of excitement from our customers around Lunar Lake, and so we'll be balancing our portfolio and our mix across our foundries.
John Pitzer: Thanks, Joe. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?
Operator: Certainly. And our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your question, please.
C.J. Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question for Lip Bu. You touched on your AI strategy. Focusing on new and emerging workloads like reasoning models, the gen pick AI, and physical AI. Is the plan here to reinvent x86 to succeed in the AI world or perhaps a broader portfolio, including ARM? And then should we be interpreting your focus more on edge AI?
Lip Bu Tan: Thank you. Yeah. Good question, CJ. I think first of all, as I articulate and not on the AI strategy, it's very important to understanding the workload. And then, you know, make sure that we can really deliver. And then clearly, we're going to look for partnership with the industry leader to build a purpose-built silicon and the software to optimize for that platform. So we like to be the compute platform for doing that. And clearly, I think one of the big areas would be the kind of edge and inference area. And that will be important to have the architecture that is low power and drive efficiency. And so those kinds of things that we are exploring some of this new architecture and some of this disruptive platform that we try to build. So stay tuned. Over time, we're going to start to articulate the strategy for that.
John Pitzer: CJ, do you have a follow-up question?
C.J. Muse: I do, John. Thanks. Dave, to follow-up on the OpEx guide for 'twenty-five and 'twenty-six, do those numbers fully contemplate the headcount reductions that you are planning? Or, you know, over time, could we see additional savings?
David Zinsner: I would say, you know, Lip Bu has driven us to think about the company in a leaner, more efficient, faster-to-execution kind of way. And that's been kind of the underpinning of what we are doing from an OpEx perspective. So it's all of that, you know, elimination of the bureaucracy, taking out the layers and support, that drive us to a number that's kind of in this $17 billion range for 25 and $16 billion range for 26. We are still in the process of, you know, working through the details of how we lay into that number. But I feel confident based on his direction, we will land in that ZIP code for those numbers. We have not yet identified what that means from a headcount perspective. You know, there's obviously other categories of spend in operating expenses in addition to labor, and, you know, those will also be looked at and we'll scrutinize and make sure that they're spent in a highly efficient manner, and we'll have more details around how we will land the $16 billion number for '26 when we end the second quarter and do the earnings in July, I think we'll have a good sense of, you know, what that means. Whether it can be reduced further, I think we'll have to see. I think the $16 billion number, we feel very confident we can land. We'll update you in July as to, you know, for sure where that number is with a little bit more precision. You know, I think if you asked Lip Bu today, he'd probably say there are areas where he would like to invest as well. So to the extent we're freeing up investment, it may go to some other areas that he wants to invest in. So, you know, I think $16 billion would probably be the good working assumption. But we'll update you in July, like I said.
John Pitzer: Thanks, CJ. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?
Operator: Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho. Your question, please.
Vijay Rakesh: Yeah. Hi. I was just wondering, as you look at the data center site, how you see that playing out through the year? I saw you may you kinda kinda June and you saw DJ apologize. Can you restate that? You broke up a little bit at the beginning of the question. Just wondering how the data center side would play out to the end of the year. As you look at the second half, especially.
Michelle Johnston Holthaus: Yeah. Thank you for the question. As we look at, you know, Q1, we saw higher-than-expected growth, really driven by a few hyperscalers. We are optimistic about the rest of the year. If you look at, you know, the product roadmap we have with Granite Rapids coming out and Xeon six, some of the traditional consolidation that that drives as well as, you know, being the CPO choice as the AI head node. And we are starting to see some improvement in telco as well. However, as Dave and everyone's talked about, you know, we still do see a large macro concern, and so we need to continue to understand what that means. Much like we talked about before in client, we are seeing strong demand on older gen parts in data center as well, and we're working through that from a supply perspective. As stated in last quarter's earnings, I talked about our main goal being to stabilize market segment share, create margin, and, you know, up ASPs, and so those are things that we're going to be laser-focused on for the remainder of the year. We do have a good product portfolio. We do see, you know, strength both in hyperscalers and enterprise, but the rest of the world is where we really see a market segment share challenge, and so that's where we'll be focused.
John Pitzer: Vijay, do you have a follow-up question?
Vijay Rakesh: Yes. Thanks, John. And, Lip Bu, congratulations on the new assignment. Just looking at CapEx, maybe this is for Dave. Any thoughts on how you would look at CapEx through that time frame, 25-26? Are you looking at rationalizing that given the footprint, fab footprint that you have?
David Zinsner: Yeah. Yeah. Oh, go ahead. Sorry. Go ahead, please. Okay. In '25, you know, we think we can operate to an $18 billion number as we talked about. I would just tell you we have $50 billion or so of assets under construction, you know, that are a lot of which are equipment that's still in bubble wrap. So we're in some ways, you know, taking a more aggressive approach to driving better return on what we've spent already. And that's allowing us to spend less in capital. I think that story probably plays out next year as well, although I think it's too early to talk about guidance for CapEx for next year. You know, we're gonna leverage our assets under construction next year as well. You know, longer term, you know, this is a high-intensity model, obviously. You know, we've talked about roughly having 25% capital intensity as we look at this in a full IDM model. And I think that's probably a good working assumption on a long-term basis.
John Pitzer: Thank you, Vijay. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?
Operator: Certainly. And our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your question, please.
Stacy Rasgon: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to go back to that seven nanometer constraint capacity constraint. Think you're seeing a lot of demand for Raptor Lake. I guess I'm just surprised given how good Meteor Lake and Lunar Lake are supposed to be. Like, why are you seeing so much more demand for the older generation parts versus new ones? Or is it, I mean, are you pushing the older gen stuff like you because the margins are better? Like, what's going on there?
Michelle Johnston Holthaus: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Stacy. We're not pushing the old parts based on what we're really seeing is much greater demand from our customers for N-one and N-two products, so that they can continue to deliver system price points that consumers are really demanding. As we've all talked about, the macroeconomic concerns and tariffs have everybody kind of hedging their bets in what they need to have from an inventory perspective. And Raptor Lake is a great part. Meteor Lake and Lunar Lake are great as well, but come with a much higher cost structure, not only for us, but at the system, ASP price points for our OEMs as well. And so as you think about an OEM perspective, they've also, you know, ridden those cost curves down from a Raptor Lake perspective, and it allows them to offer that product at a better price point. So I really just think it's, you know, macroeconomics, the overall economy, and how they're hedging their bets.
John Pitzer: Stacy, do you have a follow-up?
Stacy Rasgon: I do. To follow-up on that then, so what does that imply for the Panther Lake launch, which I guess is gonna happen, you said, by year-end. So I guess we'll get at least one SKU by December. Most of it comes this year. But if that's happening, like, in the midst of a macro event, tariffs, like, who knows? Like, how do I think about, like, the launch of those new products given, like, demand seems to be pivoting back to the older products and the environment hasn't even gotten bad yet.
Michelle Johnston Holthaus: I think it's a very fair question. The Panther Lake launch matches exactly what we did on both Meteor Lake and Lunar Lake in regards to timing, so it's very aligned with how customers like to take products to market. Panther Lake is a great product both from a performance and price perspective for our customers, so I think you'll see a strong uptake of that product, right? We still see very strong commercial demand for AIPC. As they are deploying their fleets, as they're doing their upgrades, they want to future-proof their products and have that AI capability. So I don't think you're going to see that change in commercial. And if you look at our traditional ramp for these types of products, we tend to go faster in Commercial first and then consumers come on board. And so we'll have to balance where is the economy at the end of the year, but I feel very bullish about the Panther Lake product. And our customer feedback.
John Pitzer: Thanks, Stacy. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?
Operator: Certainly. And our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from Raymond James.
Srini Pajjuri: Thank you. Michelle, I wanna go back to the comments you made about the server market, in particular about the Q2 guidance. I'm just curious as to why Q2 is tracking a little bit weaker. And then as we look out to the next few quarters, I know you talked about Granite ramping. Also potentially TAM growing from a, you know, per core basis in double digits. But at the same time, you know, we do have incremental competition from ARM, especially in head nodes where I think you guys have done well. So I'm just wondering how to think about, you know, maybe talk about why the guidance is a little softer for Q2 and then how to think about your market share for the next few quarters? Thank you.
Michelle Johnston Holthaus: Yes, thank you for the question. As I look at Q1, I mean, we had a few hyperscalers that were particularly strong in Q1. And so, you know, you could call that, you know, hedging your bets or doing pull-ins or just balancing out their portfolio. But we don't expect to continue to see that into Q2. And so when we look at the overall macro demand, concern around tariffs and restrictions, as well as the stronger demand for older generation parts. There's more demand there than we currently can supply, and so you have to balance that as well. And then as I've continued to say, we're gonna do everything we can to stabilize market segment share. But that also creates a lot of margin and ASP pressure that we need to balance throughout the year. And so Granite Rapids is a great product. We are seeing excitement from our customers around that. Particularly in the consolidation, particularly with Edge AI, a lot of excitement from customers about finding ways to be able to offer service revenue there. But at the same time, as you said, there is good competition. And so we're just being, you know, I think very prudent in what the year looks like. We understand there is competition, but we've got a good product portfolio, but as Lip Bu said, we want a very strong Seydou ratio. So we're going to commit to a number that we can beat.
John Pitzer: Srini, do you have a quick follow-up?
Srini Pajjuri: Yeah. And then on Panther Lake, I know Lip Bu said, you know, it's a priority to ramp AT and A with Panther Lake. I know in the past, your target was to, I guess, bring in 70% of the die in-house, to 18A. Just wondering if that's still the target. And then, as we look forward to NovoLake, has the decision about, you know, internal versus external been made yet? If so, you know, maybe you can give us some color on that as to what percent or, you know, how you think about internal versus external mix for NOLA. Thank you.
Michelle Johnston Holthaus: Yeah, both are great questions. When we look at 18A, our goal of bringing everything in-house, getting to a 70%, approximately 70% mix, remains steadfast, and there's no change to that POR, and Pantherlight helps us get on that journey. You know, talked about this in Q3. I talked about it in Q4. One of the great strengths we have is the fact that we do have optionality when it comes to where we build our products. We build products with TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. And so when you look at Nova Lake, really, what we've done is we've optimized at the SKU level the process node that we're going to use. And so when you look at Nova Lake, you'll see product both at TSMC, and you'll see product internal to Intel. But when you look at the aggregate of Nova Lake, we will build more wafers on Intel process than we are on Panther Lake. So that commitment to continue to drive wafer growth with our internal foundry partners remains steadfast, and there's no change to strategy there.
David Zinsner: I just add one other thing that just I come over the top of the organization on. Is we are going to continue to balance internal and external manufacturing of wafers. We do that because that's part of our capital strategy to maintain a reasonable capital intensity relative to the business. So just as much as, you know, we're pushing on filling the fab and making sure we're utilizing all of our assets and leveraging the investments we've made on the process side, we also wanna make sure that we're not over-investing in capital and are left, ultimately with a bad answer from a return on asset perspective. So that's part of our smart capital strategy is always to keep a certain percentage of our wafer capacity outside.
John Pitzer: Thank you, Srini. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?
Operator: Certainly. And our next question comes from the line of Thomas O'Malley from Barclays. Your question, please.
Thomas O'Malley: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. This one is for Dave. Little more shorter term. Just if you look at the first twenty-something days of the quarter here, I was surprised that you saw a little bit of weakness in the client. Obviously, data center down a little bit more. But could you maybe just give us an update on if you're seeing any pull-ins, any changes in dynamics from a geography perspective? Any customer behaviors that are looking any different for the first couple of days of this quarter? Just as it helps as a framework for the entire market and then also for you guys as well.
David Zinsner: Yeah. I would just say that, you know, for the first whatever number of days that is off, I didn't count it. So I'm assuming it is twenty days. We are off to a relatively strong start. But what we are anticipating and what's built into our guidance is that, you know, the macro is going to start to catch up to the implications of the tariffs. And so June is likely to be softer than our strong start to the quarter. But so far, we're off to a strong start. Of course, I can't completely rule out that it might continue through the whole quarter, in which case we're, you probably looking at the higher end of the guidance. But for now, we've built in the expectation that, you know, tariffs will start to weigh on the macro.
John Pitzer: Tom, do you have a follow-up?
Thomas O'Malley: Yeah. I do. Michelle, in December when we chatted when you when you first took over the job, you spoke about products being first. And, specifically, we talked about the data center side of things. And, I think earlier to CJ's questions, you addressed the edge. But if you look at the products that you've had with Gowdy, Falcon Shores inside the data center specifically, could you talk about what the strategy will be going forward? Are you planning on launching a new product think at the time you said, we need to learn with what we've already had, so we're not starting from scratch. But any update to that strategy, particularly inside the data center?
Michelle Johnston Holthaus: Yeah. I'm glad that you asked. Actually, you know, in the first five weeks, that Lip Bu has been here, he and Sachin have spent a significant amount of time relooking at our whole AI strategy, our portfolio of assets, how we need to come to market to be able to compete in that marketplace. You've heard Lip Bu really talk about the fact that we want a workload-first approach. And so in Q4, I talked about the fact that we weren't gonna build Falcon Shores. Right? And that we were gonna stay with the POR of Jaguar Shores. So we still have a Jaguar product on our roadmap. And Sachin and Lip Bu over the coming months or so. We'll start to talk externally about what our AI roadmap looks like, what we'll do in between then. And then as we really dive in with our customers on that workload roadmap, what needs to change. But I think you'll see us be quite aggressive. We know that that is a segment of the data center market that we're not competing in today. And we need a robust portfolio as all the customers are looking for alternatives.
John Pitzer: Thanks, Tom. Jonathan, can we have the next question, please?
Operator: Certainly. And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Your question, please.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my questions. Lip Bu, for the first one. You there are no quick fixes. So how much time realistically should investors be prepared for in terms of Intel's turnaround? Is it one year, two years? Three years? And related to that, what are the right metrics to measure that progress? Is it share gains? Is it gross margins? Is it free cash flow? So, basically, what metric are you optimizing for, and what is the timeline in order to achieve that?
Lip Bu Tan: Okay. Thanks. Good question. So I think, you know, clearly, there's no quick fix. And as you described. And as we're working through the roadmap and weekly update with the team, and then defining what is the new workload look like in terms of the, you know, the CPU, GPU, and AI and then driving the some short term and some longer-term products. And then shorter term, we may embrace some of the disruptive technology that's out there and we can partner with them to bring the market faster and then meet the customer requirement. So I think stay tuned. I mean, those are the things that we're working on. In terms of the matrix, clearly, want to have the best products. And that is really, you know, especially at addressing the edge because of your power efficient. And also able to drive the performance that we like. And time to market is critical on schedule. And so those are the things that we look at in terms of matrix to really deliver what the industry wants and customers want and that's something that we're working on.
John Pitzer: Vivek, do you have a quick follow-up?
Vivek Arya: Yes. Thanks, John. So on the IDM structure, Lip Bu, you know, given your experience in the industry, you know, what we have seen from the outside is that the most successful businesses in semis are either fabless or dedicated foundry. And a few years ago, when Intel started to give out financials for the manufacturing business, the hope was that that would turn it around. But what we have seen is just consistently negative gross margin. So do you think that just AT and A progress is sufficient, just kind of low single-digit top-line growth is sufficient to make this business viable? So at what point, you know, do you need to rethink whether this IDM structure, regardless of the way, financials are broken out, does it make sense?
Lip Bu Tan: Right. I think it's a good question. So I think clearly, we want to have that kind of a balanced approach. One is our, you know, the foundry got to be able to deliver the product that internal customers need. And also can serve our Intel customers well. So that we make them the simplicity also online schedule to deliver. And then meanwhile, you know, in that respect, we clearly view TSMC as our partner and they have been very good partners to have. And Morris and Cece are very long-time friends of mine. And we also, we now met recently, try to find areas we can collaborate and so that we can create a win-win situation. And then meanwhile, we continue to drive the efficiency, the yield, that AT and A and also look at with the customer what can we do on the 14A and then so that we can really wisely effectively using some of the foundry capacity footprint that we have.
John Pitzer: Vivek, thank you. Jonathan, we've got time for one last question, please.
Operator: Certainly. And our final question for today comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your question, please.
Aaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks, John, for fitting me in. I guess maybe the first question would be is just as I think about the guidance that you gave and, you know, more importantly, the operating expense structure that you talked about 25-26. Just to be very clear, that that's exclusive of the pending divestiture of 51% stake in Altera. I guess that's just a point of clarification.
David Zinsner: Yeah. Let me decide what exclusive means. But, essentially, the $17 billion in '25 and the $16 billion in '26 actually assume Altera's OpEx is in that number. Now, you know, obviously, as soon as we deconsolidate it, it won't be. So, you know, the target of the 60 will come down. You know, dollar for dollar for what Altera is spending in terms of OpEx. But given that it hasn't closed, we don't know the timing of when it closes. It was a little difficult to provide anything. With that built into the forecast, so we just included it.
John Pitzer: Aaron, do you have a follow-up?
Aaron Rakers: Fair enough. I do. And it's maybe more strategic back to kind of the core data center AI strategy. And I know it's early days, but Lip Bu, I'm curious of how you think about, you know, RackScale, you know, networking and the pieces that Intel has internally to really compete in the cloud infrastructure AI build-out. Is it UCIE? Is there other pieces of the building blocks that you think strategically is needed to really drive if it's with Jaguar Shores or, you know, how that strategy plays out around the networking scale upside?
Lip Bu Tan: Yeah. It's a good question. So let me start first and then Michelle will add on to it. So clearly, the RackScale approach of the system, I think is very important. That we need to have a full scale in those hardware and software to do it. And then clearly leverage on our XPU in our CPU and GPU approach and then to drive that. And I think, you know, there will be something that we kinda work on and then come up with a killing product that we can really launch the product.
Michelle Johnston Holthaus: Yeah. Maybe I would just add that, you know, we are seeing great success with the IPU products that we've built. We will see at least double-digit or, excuse me, doubling of that revenue from 24 to 25. We also see optics as a critical element of that rack scale architecture as well. And I think I would just remind everybody that Intel is the only foundry out there that has an optics-based foundry option for our customers, and so we're very optimistic that those two things add to the overall opportunity to build out that RackScale architecture. Also just our OpenX 86. What we are seeing is that customers do love the x86 ecosystem, the software around it, and if they can build out an AI infrastructure with x86, they're very interested in doing that. We already have one large custom design win, and I would expect more.
Lip Bu Tan: With that, thank you for joining us today. We have a clear opportunity to strengthen our business in both products and foundry. We have clear priorities to better serve our customers and create value for our shareholders. I look forward to the work ahead as we build the new Intel. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",2025-04-24
