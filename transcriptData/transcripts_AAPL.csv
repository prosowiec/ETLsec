AAPL,2024,1,2024-Q1-AAPL,"Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Apple Q1 Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions. I would like to turn the call over to Suhasini Chandramouli, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook; and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Before turning the call over to Tim, I would like to remind everyone that the quarter we're reporting today included 13 weeks, whereas the quarter we reported a year ago included 14 weeks. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook, including the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions on the company's business and results of operations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and the form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.
Tim Cook: Thank you. Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $119.6 billion for the December quarter, up 2% from a year ago despite having one less week in the quarter. EPS was $2.18, up 16% from a year ago and an all-time record. We achieved revenue records across more than two dozen countries and regions including all-time records in Europe and rest of Asia-Pacific. We also continue to see strong double-digit growth in many emerging markets with all-time records in Malaysia, Mexico, The Philippines, Poland, and Turkey, as well as December quarter records in India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, and Chile. In Services, we set an all-time revenue record with paid subscriptions growing double-digits year-over-year. And I'm pleased to announce today that we have set a new record for our installed base, which has now surpassed 2.2 billion active devices. We are announcing these results on the eve of what is sure to be a historic day as we enter the era of spatial computing. Starting tomorrow, Apple Vision Pro, the most advanced personal electronics device ever, will be available in Apple stores for customers in the U.S. with expansion to other countries later this year. Apple Vision Pro is a revolutionary device built on decades of Apple innovation and it's years ahead of anything else. Apple Vision Pro has a groundbreaking new input system and thousands of innovations, and it will unlock incredible experiences for users and developers that are simply not possible on any other device. There is already so much excitement behind this product from reviewers, customers, and developers. They are praising everything from the incredible experience of watching a movie on a 100-foot screen to remarkable new machine learning capabilities like hand tracking and room mapping. We can't wait for people to experience the magic for themselves. Moments like these are what we live for at Apple. They're why we do what we do. They're why we're so unflinchingly dedicated to groundbreaking innovation and why we're so focused on pushing technology to its limits as we work to enrich the lives of our users. As we look ahead, we will continue to invest in these and other technologies that will shape the future. That includes artificial intelligence where we continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort, and we're excited to share the details of our ongoing work in that space later this year. Now, let's turn to the results for the December quarter, beginning with iPhone. We are proud to report that revenue came in at $69.7 billion, 6% higher than a year ago. The iPhone 15 lineup has earned glowing reviews and been embraced by customers. The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus feature a gorgeous new design with color-infused back glass and contoured edges, Dynamic Island, A16 Bionic, and a new 48 megapixel camera system. And the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max set the gold standard for smartphones with a beautiful and lighter titanium design, industry-leading performance with A17 Pro and our most advanced camera system with the equivalent of seven pro lenses and the ability to record spatial video. Features like Emergency SoS and roadside assistance via satellite bring peace of mind to users when they travel, and I'm grateful for every note I've received about their lifesaving impact. Turning to Mac. Revenue came in at $7.8 billion, up 1% year-over-year, driven by the strength of our latest M3-powered MacBook Pro models in spite of having one less week of sales. Just last week, we got to wish Mac a happy 40th birthday. When it was introduced 40 years ago, Mac changed everything, and through the years, it has done so again and again. Recently, we have been on a tremendous pace of innovation. Since the introduction of Apple silicon in 2020, we've been proud to offer our users unmatched performance and power along with a remarkable Neural Engine for artificial intelligence and machine learning. This past fall, we had an amazing launch of the latest generation of Apple silicon for Mac, M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max. These chips break new ground in power and performance empowering users to do more than they ever could before, whether they're making a musical masterpiece using the latest features in Logic Pro, or beating their high score in a graphics intensive game. A favorite amongst students, business owners, artists, and video editors, our MacBook Pro lineup is the world's best pro notebook family. And iMac, the world's most capable and best-selling all-in one, is now faster than ever, thanks to M3. In iPad, revenue for the December quarter was $7 billion, down 25% year-over-year due to a difficult compare with the launch of the M2 iPad Pro and the 10th generation iPad during the December quarter last year and one less week of sales. iPad remains the most versatile, capable, and elegant tablet on the market today. It continues to be the go-to-device for students, creators, and more with customers loving iPad's incredible combination of portability and performance. Powerful apps like Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro for iPad allow video and music creators to unleash their creativity in new ways that are only possible on iPad. iPad continues to push the boundaries of what's possible on a tablet. In Wearables, Home and Accessories, revenue came in at $12 billion, down 11% from a year ago due to a difficult compare with the launch timing of several products in this category and the impact of the 14th week last year. Across our latest Apple Watch lineup, we're enabling and encouraging our users to live a healthier day, while making Apple Watch even more intuitive to use. The new double tap gesture on Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 make it easier to answer calls, play and pause music or take a photo with iPhone. I've been deeply moved by the many touching stories about how features like a regular rhythm notification and fall detection helped Apple Watch users when they needed it most. And for the first time ever, users can choose a carbon-neutral option of any new Apple Watch. Meanwhile, our AirPods lineup continue to be a holiday favorite. In Services, we set an all-time revenue record of $23.1 billion and an 11% year-over-year increase. Because we had one less week this quarter, this growth represents an acceleration from the September quarter, and we achieved all-time revenue records across advertising, cloud services, payment services and video, as well as December quarter records in App Store and AppleCare. Across our services, we're constantly growing our offerings to give users even more to love. With the redesigned Apple TV app, we've made it easier for subscribers to enjoy all their favorite shows, movies and sports, including Apple TV+ hits like Masters of the Air, Monarch, and Slow Horses. We're proud to be a part of Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon, a film that has moved audiences and earned more than 200 accolades including Best Film of the Year from the New York Film Critics Circle, nine BAFTA nominations, a Golden Globe win, and 10 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. Across all Apple TV+ productions, we've now earned 2050 award nominations and 450 wins since we've introduced the service. We're also excited to have a new season of Major League Soccer kicking off this month. We're looking forward to seeing Lionel Messi return to the field and to following all of our favorite teams in what is sure to be an incredible season. And we're counting down to the Apple Music Super Bowl halftime show, featuring Usher. Turning to Retail. In recent months, we opened three stores, including our 100th store in Asia-Pacific. Throughout the holidays, our team members pulled out all the stops to help customers find the perfect gift. And I know our U.S. team members are especially excited to begin demoing Apple Vision Pro for our customers tomorrow. At Apple, we live and breathe innovation. We are driven to pioneer new technology that can enrich our customers' lives, and we're just as intentional about showing up with our values and being a force for good in the world. February is Black History Month, and to honor it, we've launched our new Black Unity Collection, which includes the Black Unity Sport Loop band. This year's designs reflect a lasting commitment to working toward a more equitable world. We also continue to do a central work through our Racial Equity and Justice Initiative, and we're proud to continue providing grants to organizations that are making a real impact in the world. In recent months, we've also taken significant strides in our environmental work. We're partnering with suppliers to bring more clean energy online for Apple production. We're using more recycled materials than ever before and more energy-efficient transportation than ever before. And each day, we are taking more and more steps toward becoming 100% carbon-neutral across all of our products by 2030. Apple is a company that has never shied away from big challenges. That's because we are grounded by a deep sense of purpose and guided by core belief in the transformative power of innovation. And so, we are optimistic about the future, confident in the long-term, and as excited as we've ever been to deliver for our users like only Apple can. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.
Luca Maestri: Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the December quarter was $119.6 billion, up 2% from last year. During the December quarter a year ago, two unique factors affected our results. First, we had an additional week in the quarter. And second, we had COVID-related factory shutdowns that limited iPhone supply. We estimate that the net impact of these two factors resulted in a 2 percentage point headwind to our revenue performance this quarter. We set all-time revenue records in Europe and rest of Asia-Pacific, and continue to see strong performance across our emerging markets with double-digit growth in the majority of the emerging markets we track. Products revenue was $96.5 billion, flat compared to last year, driven by strength in iPhone, offset by challenging compares for iPad and Wearables, Home and Accessories and one less week of sales this year across the entire portfolio. Thanks to our unparalleled customer loyalty and very strong levels of customer satisfaction, our total installed base of active devices set a new record across all products and all geographic segments, and is now over 2.2 billion active devices. Services revenue set an all-time record of $23.1 billion, up 11% year-over-year. When we take into account the extra week last year, this represents a sequential acceleration of growth from the September quarter. We are very pleased with our Services performance in both developed and emerging markets with all-time revenue records in the Americas, Europe, and rest of Asia-Pacific. Company gross margin was 45.9%, up 70 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage and favorable mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Products gross margin was 39.4%, up 280 basis points sequentially, also driven by leverage and mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Services gross margin was 72.8%, up 190 basis points from last quarter, due to a more favorable mix. Operating expenses of $14.5 billion were at the midpoint of the guidance range we provided and up 1% year-over-year. Net income was $33.9 billion, up $3.9 billion from last year. Diluted EPS was $2.18, up 16% versus last year and an all-time record. And operating cash flow was very strong at $39.9 billion. Let me now provide more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $69.7 billion, up 6% year-over-year. We set all-time records in several countries and regions, including Latin America, Western Europe, the Middle East, and Korea, as well as December quarter records in India and Indonesia. Our iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high, and we had an all-time record number of iPhone upgraders during the quarter. Customers are loving their new iPhone 15 family, with the latest reports from 451 Research indicating customer satisfaction of 99% in the U.S. In fact, many iPhone models were among the top-selling smartphones around the world during the quarter. According to a survey from Kantar, iPhones were four out of the top five models in the U.S. and Japan, four out of the top six models in urban China and the UK, and all top five models in Australia. Mac generated revenue of $7.8 billion and return to growth, despite one less week of sales this year. This represents a significant acceleration from the September quarter when we faced a challenging compare due to the supply disruptions and subsequent demand recapture we experienced a year ago. Customer response to our latest iMac and MacBook Pro models powered by the M3 chips has been great. And our Mac installed base reached an all-time high with almost half of Mac buyers during the quarter being new to the product. Also, 451 Research recently reported customer satisfaction of 97% for Mac in the U.S. iPad was $7 billion in revenue, down 25% year-over-year. iPad faced a difficult compare because during the December quarter last year, we launched the new iPad Pro and iPad 10 generation, and we had an extra week of sales. However, the iPad installed base continues to grow and is an all-time high with over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter being new to the product, and customer satisfaction for iPad was recently measured at 98% in the U.S. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $12 billion, down 11% year-over-year due to a challenging launch compare and the extra week a year ago. This time last year, we had the full quarter benefit from the launches of the AirPods Pro 2nd generation, the Watch SE, and the first Watch Ultra. We continue to attract new customers to Apple Watch. Nearly two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter were new to the product, and the latest reports from 451 Research indicate customer satisfaction of 96% in the U.S. And in Services, we were very pleased with our double-digit growth, which was driven by the strength of our ecosystem. Our installed base is now over 2.2 billion active devices and continues to grow nicely, establishing a solid foundation for the future expansion of our Services business. And we continue to see increased customer engagement with our services. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts reached a new all-time high, with paid accounts growing double-digits year-over-year. Also, our paid subscriptions showed strong double-digit growth. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, more than double the number that we had only four years ago. Finally, we continue to build on the breadth and the quality of our current services. From Oscar-nominated theatrical releases with Apple TV+ to more publications or News+ like The Atlantic and exciting new games on Arcade. Turning to Enterprise, we continue to see many business customers leverage Apple products to improve productivity and drive innovation. Target recently added the latest M3 MacBook Pro to their existing deployment of thousands of Mac’s, enabling employees across various departments to do their best work. In emerging markets, Zoho, a leading technology company headquartered in India, offers its 15,000 plus global employees a choice of devices, with 80% of their workforce using iPhone for work and nearly two-thirds of them choosing Mac as their primary computer. With the upcoming launch of Apple Vision Pro, we are seeing strong excitement in Enterprise. Leading organizations across many industries such as Walmart, Nike, Vanguard, Stryker, Bloomberg, and SAP have started leveraging and investing in Apple Vision Pro as their new platform to bring innovative spatial computing experiences to their customers and employees. From everyday productivity to collaborative product design to immersive training, we cannot wait to see the amazing things our enterprise customers will create in the months and years to come. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $173 billion in cash and marketable securities. We decreased commercial paper by $4 billion, leaving us with total debt of $108 billion. As a result, net cash was $65 billion at the end of the quarter, and our goal of becoming net cash-neutral over time remains unchanged. During the quarter, we returned nearly $27 billion to shareholders, including $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $20.5 billion through open market repurchases of 112 million Apple shares. We also retired an additional 6 million shares in the final settlement of our 19th ASR. As usual, we will provide an update to our capital return program when we report results at the end of this quarter. As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we are providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. And we expect foreign exchange to be a revenue headwind of about 2 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. As a reminder, in the December quarter a year ago, we faced significant supply constraints on the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max due to COVID-19 factory shutdowns. And in the March quarter a year ago, we were able to replenish channel inventory and fulfill significant pent-up demand from the constraints. We estimate that this impact added close to $5 billion to the March quarter's total revenue last year. When we remove this impact from last year's revenue, we expect both our March quarter total company revenue and iPhone revenue to be similar to a year ago. For our Services business, we expect a similar double-digit growth rate to what we reported in the December quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 46% and 47%. We expect OpEx to be between $14.3 billion and $14.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be around $50 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share of common stock payable on February 15, 2024, to shareholders of record as of February 12, 2024. With that, let's open the call to questions.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question please?
Operator: Certainly. We'll go ahead and take our first question from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Erik Woodring: Hey guys, good evening. Thank you for taking my questions. I have two. And congrats on the nice quarter here. Luca, maybe if we start with you. Can you unpackage some of the Services drivers a bit for us. Obviously, really nice outperformance in the December quarter versus your expectations. A record gross margin implies your higher margin businesses were likely the sources of outperformance. But can you maybe just clarify a bit how we should think about Services growth for the March quarter? And then, speak to some of those underlying drivers in the December quarter and then in the March quarter, what the different puts and takes would be? And then, I have a follow-up please. Thank you.
Luca Maestri: Thanks, Erik, for the question. Let's start with the December quarter. As we said, up 11%, $23.1 billion is an all-time record for us, with all-time records in The Americas, in Europe, and the rest of Asia Pac. So it was pretty broad-based geographically, and very strong across all the Services categories, because we had all-time revenue records for cloud, for payments, for video, and for advertising and December quarter records for the App Store and for AppleCare. Obviously, last year, we had an extra week, so the 11% is stronger than -- the underlying performance is stronger than the 11% that we have reported. I think the entire ecosystem is doing well because we continue to see growth and new all-time highs in both transacting accounts and paid accounts, which is obviously very important. And paid subscriptions continue to grow strong double-digits. Just as a reference, we have more than a billion paid subscriptions across all the services on our platform. This is more than double the number of paid subscriptions that we had only four years ago. So, obviously, very significant growth there. What I said during the prepared remarks around the March quarter, I mentioned that we will continue to grow double-digits at a percentage that is similar to what we reported for the December quarter. We don't provide guidance around the different services categories. So, we will provide more color when we report in three months.
Erik Woodring: Okay. Thank you, Luca. And then, Tim, really nice to see your installed base reach a record high, again, against all products and geos. I'm wondering if you could share a bit more detail about the new users you were able to on-board over the last 12 months. Meaning, how might this new cohort look different from past cohorts, either in terms of geographic representation or SKU to certain products or even how their monetization trends might differ from past cohorts. And that's it from me. Thanks so much.
Tim Cook: Yes. Hi, Erik. I would say emerging markets are -- have been a very key area of strength for us. If you look at it, India grew -- in revenue terms grew strong double-digits in the December quarter and hit a quarter revenue record. The other emerging markets like Indonesia also hit a quarterly record. And we had several regions, with records from Latin America to the Middle East. And that theme has been pretty consistent across the other quarters that -- of the year as well. And so, emerging markets, very, very important. And I feel like we are doing a great job there.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Erik. Operator, can we have the next question please?
Operator: Our next question is from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Mike Ng: Hey, good afternoon. I just have two questions as well. First, on Services. Just on the outlook for the March quarter for a similar double-digit growth rate as of December quarter. I'm just wondering why not -- why won't it be potentially faster, given that the December quarter obviously had a headwind from the extra week comp, and I'd also think that some of the pricing uplifts on select Apple One services that were implemented last winter should help in the March quarter? Any additional thoughts there would be great in terms of what some of your assumptions are. And then, I have a quick follow-up.
Luca Maestri: Yes. We'll see how the quarter develops. I would point to two things. One is the fact that we mentioned that we expect a couple of points of negative foreign exchange in the March quarter, and foreign exchange was essentially flat for us in the December quarter. So, you've got a bit of a headwind there. And then, when you look at our other progression of our Services business over the last few quarters, the compares for March are slightly more difficult than the compares for December.
Mike Ng: Great. Thank you, Luca. And then, my second question. It was very interesting to hear about some of the enterprise customer investments into Vision Pro. Could you maybe just talk about some of the efforts to support Vision Pro developer ecosystem. And it was also good to hear about the potential upcoming announcements on AI. So any thoughts there would also be helpful. Thank you.
Tim Cook: Yeah. Hi. It's -- we are incredibly excited about the Enterprise opportunities with Vision Pro. I've seen several demos from different companies. Luca mentioned several in his opening remarks, but Walmart has a very cool merchandising app. There are firms that are doing collaboration -- design collaboration apps. There are field service applications. Really all over the map, there are applications that are for control center, command center kind of things. SAP has really gotten behind it and, of course, SAP is in so many of companies. I think there will be a great opportunity for us in Enterprise, and we couldn't be more excited about where things are right now. We are obviously looking forward to tomorrow. This has been multiple years of efforts from so many people across Apple. And really, it took a whole of company effort to bring it to this far. In terms of generative AI, which, I'd guess, is your focus, we have a lot of work going on internally as I've alluded to before. Our MO, if you will, has always been to do work and then talk about work and not to get out in front of ourselves. And so, we're going to hold that to this as well. But we've got some things that we are incredibly excited about that we'll be talking about later this year.
Mike Ng: Wonderful. Thank you, Tim.
Tim Cook: Yes.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Mike. Operator, can we have the next question please?
Operator: Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Wamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you so much. I have two questions as well. First on iPhone. There have been concerns around replacement cycles lengthening, China competition intensifying, and you still beat iPhone revenues despite the weaker performance in China. Curious how you're thinking about the 15 cycle overall, given what you saw in the December quarter. And I've a follow-up.
Tim Cook: Hi, it's Tim. The -- we were up 6%, as we mentioned in the opening remarks. We are happy with that performance. Underneath there, we had really strong performance in several parts of the world with all-time records in Europe and rest of Asia-Pacific. As I mentioned earlier, we did particularly well in several emerging markets from Latin America to the Middle East. And we set December quarter records in India and Indonesia. And so, really some spectacular broad-based reactions to iPhone. We also importantly set an all-time record worldwide for iPhone upgraders. And the installed base hit a new all-time high consistent with the -- our overall devices. And so, there's lot of good things. Luca mentioned in his opening comments that iPhones were four out of the top five smartphone models in the U.S. and Japan and four out of the top six in urban China and the UK, and all top five in Australia, and the customer satisfaction level for iPhone 15 hit 99%. If you look at iPhone 15 since the announcement of it and shipment in September, so this is including some of Q4 and you compare that to iPhone 14 over the same period of time, iPhone 15 is outselling iPhone 14. And so, we feel very good about that, and the upgraders hitting a record is particularly exciting for us.
Wamsi Mohan: Great. Thank you, Tim. And as a follow-up, obviously, you're just launching the Vision Pro and it's an entirely new category. It's a price point that's a much higher starting price point relative to most of your other, probably over the last decade, product introductions, but just wondering how would you measure the success of Vision Pro over time and which Apple products adoption curve would you look at as potentially the most similar? And is there a way in which we could think Vision Pro could eclipse maybe something like the iPad in revenue over time. Thank you.
Tim Cook: You know, each product has its own journey. And so, I wouldn't want to compare it to any one in particular. I would just say we couldn't be more excited. Internally, we've got an incredible amount of excitement from developers and from customers that can't wait till tomorrow to pick up their units. And we are incredibly proud to be able to demo the unit in so many of our stores in the U.S. starting tomorrow for people that are -- that want to check it out. And so, we'll see and report the results of it in the Wearables category that you're familiar with. I think that if you look at it from a price point of view, there's an incredible amount of technology that's packed into the product. There's 5,000 patents in the product and it's, of course, built on many innovations that Apple has spent multiple years on, from silicon to displays and significant AI and machine learning. All the hand tracking, the room mapping, all of this stuff is driven by AI. And so, we're incredibly excited about it. I can't wait to be in the store for tomorrow and see the reaction myself.
Wamsi Mohan: Thank you so much, Tim.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Wamsi. Operator, we'll take the next question please.
Operator: Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Amit Daryanani: Good afternoon. I have two as well. I guess, first off, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in China right now. I think from a geographic basis, one of the few places that was down double-digits, while everything else was growing. So, I'm hoping you spend a bit of time discussing what are you seeing there from a competitive perspective and more importantly, from a demand perspective in China?
Tim Cook: Yeah. If you look at iPhone in China Mainland, which I think has been the focus of a lot of interest, and you look at it in constant currency, so more of an operational view, we were down mid-single digits on iPhone. And so, it was the other things that drove the larger contraction year-over-year. On the good news side, we had solid growth on upgraders year-over-year in Mainland China and we had four of the top six smartphone models in urban China. Also, IDC just put out a note, that you may have seen, that we were the top brand in -- for the full year and for the December quarter. And so, there's some good news along with – obviously, we'd prefer not to [contract] (ph).
Amit Daryanani: Fair enough. And then, as a follow-up, you folks have implemented a fair bit of changes around the App Store in Europe post the DMA implementation there. Can you just touch on what are some of the key updates? And then, Luca, as a net of it all, do you see it having any significant impact financially to your services or a broader Apple P&L statement? Thank you.
Tim Cook: Yes. You know, the -- let me try to answer a little bit of both and then Luca can add some comments to it. We announced a number of changes last week in Europe that would be in effect beginning in March. So, the last month of the first calendar quarter, the second fiscal quarter. Those are -- some of the things that we announced include alternate billing opportunities, alternate app stores, our marketplaces, if you will. We're also opening NFC for new capabilities for banking and wallet apps. And so, these are some of the things we announced. The -- if you think about what we've done over the years is, we've really majored on privacy, security, and usability. And we've tried our best to get as close to the past in terms of the things that are -- that people love about our ecosystem as we can, but we are going to fall short of providing the maximum amount that we could supply, because we need to comply with the regulation. And so, in terms of predicting the choices that developers and users will make, it's very difficult to do that with precision. And so, I will see what happens in March.
Luca Maestri: Yes, Amit. As Tim said, these are changes that we're going to be implementing in March. A lot will depend on the choices that will be made. Just to keep it in context, the changes applied to the EU market, which represents roughly 7% of our global app store revenue.
Amit Daryanani: Perfect. That's a really good perspective to have. Thank you very much.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Amit. Operator, can we have the next question please?
Operator: Our next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Aaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I have two as well as you would imagine. I guess, the first question I wanted to just ask maybe unpack a little bit more, just remarkable trends that we're seeing in your product gross margin specifically. So, I'm curious as we look forward, I guess on this last quarter, where there any kind of benefits you're seeing from like just the purchase component, obligations that you've put in place, let's say, a year ago, and that flowing through. And how are you thinking about the component pricing environment as we think about that gross margin into the March quarter and looking-forward?
Luca Maestri: Yes. On the product side and then maybe I'll make a comment in total for the company. On the product side, our gross margins increased sequentially 280 basis points. So, obviously, a very significant increase. I would say the two primary components of the increase are a favorable mix. Of course, iPhone did very well. We did very well with our high-end models. And leverage, of course, it's the biggest quarter of the year for us and so we get the leverage effect. We had a partial offset, negative impact from foreign exchange. But net-net, obviously, very significant improvement. And we had very similar dynamics on the Services side where we increased sequentially 190 basis points, also, in this case, due to a more favorable mix. And so, the combined effect of the two businesses gave us the 45.9% at the total company level, which is up 70% sequentially. You've heard from my prepared remarks that we are guiding total company gross margin to 46% to 47%, which is an additional expansion of margins compared to the already very strong results of the December quarter.
Aaron Rakers: Okay. And then, the second question I was just going to ask. Tim, you alluded to kind of your excitement around generative AI and some announcements that we should think about maybe later this year. One of the things that stands out for me is that, your capital expenditures has actually come down this last year. I'm curious as you look to lean in more to generative AI, is there something we should consider about the CapEx intensity at Apple to make investments to really set the table for generative AI, kind of platform as we move forward? Just given some of the things that we've seen from some other large tech companies.
Luca Maestri: I'll take the question, Aaron. We've always said, we will never underinvest in the business. So, we are making all the investments that are necessary throughout our product development, software development, services development. And so, we will continue to invest in every area of the business and at the appropriate level. And we're very excited about what's in store for us for the rest of the year.
Aaron Rakers: Thank you.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Aaron. Operator, can we have the next question please?
Operator: Our next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Krish Sankar: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. First one for Luca, a clarification on a question. The $5 billion impact in March quarter, is that for product revenue or is that total company revenue. And along the same part, you highlighted the strong gross margins. And I understand last year, some of the commodity costs were deflationary, buy looks like it’s going to be inflationary right now. And also you've done some of the Mac conversions that -- the silicon conversions. So I'm just trying to figure out how much juice is there more to squeeze on the gross margin side? And then I'll follow up for Tim.
Luca Maestri: Yes. The -- so the first part of the question was around -- oh, the $5 billion. The $5 billion, as I mentioned, a year ago we had this disruption of supply on iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max because of the factory shutdown due to the COVID-19 situation. And so, essentially there was pent up demand as we exited December quarter, they got fulfilled and we also did the channel fill associated with it during the March quarter. So close to $5 billion that I mentioned is entirely related to iPhone. On the gross margin side, obviously, we are at very high levels of gross margin. And I'll repeat what I said before, we've had good expansion over the last few quarters and now we are guiding to 46% to 47% and that takes into account everything that is going on, which is, the commodity environment, which is the foreign exchange situation, and obviously the product and services mix. And the outcome of this is the guidance, which obviously is very strong and we're very happy with it.
Krish Sankar: Thanks a lot, Luca. And then I have a follow-up for Tim. Tim, it was very interesting to hear your comments on enterprise. And historically, Apple has been a consumer centric company. And now with Vision Pro, Mac, it's sort of penetrating more into the enterprise. I'm kind of curious how to think about Apple of the future? Would it still be consumer centric or do you think it's going to be more enterprise focused also as we get into the future? Thank you very much.
Tim Cook: We've really concluded that we can do both. That if you look at it, what has happened over the last several years is that, employees are in a position in many companies to choose their own technology that is the best for them. And so, it sort of took some of the central command from the traditional company and decentralized the decision-making. That is a huge advantage for Apple, because there's a lot of people out there that want to use a Mac. They're using a Mac at home. They'd like to use one in the office as well. iPad has also benefited from that. Vision Pro, it's -- when you look at the ton of use cases, I mean, we're starting with a million apps and 600 plus that are -- have been designed particularly for Vision Pro. When I look at what is coming out of Enterprise, it's some of the most innovative things I've seen come out of Enterprise in a long time. And so, I think there's a like there is for the Mac and iPad, and of course, iPhone has been in enterprise since the early days of iPhone. I think there's a nice opportunity there for Vision Pro as well.
Krish Sankar: Great. Thanks a lot Tim. Very interesting to hear. Thank you.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Krish. Operator, can we have the next question, please?
Operator: Our next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.
David Vogt: Great. Thanks guys. And I have two questions as well. So, Tim and Luke, I appreciate the strength in the emerging markets like India and the other names that you kind of listed on the call, but can you maybe spend some time on the Americas? Obviously, that was relatively flat, you touched on China, but what are you seeing in that market from the carriers here in the States? And is the sales cycle elongating or the replacement cycle elongating? And in your view what has to change to kind of maybe re-accelerate that business in the America's, particular in the iPhone business? And then on sort of -- I just want to make sure I understand sort of the guide. So when I think about the $5 billion pull forward last year in the March quarter from a channel fill perspective, even if I back it out last quarter or I back it up this quarter, the March quarter, this would be sort of the softest quarter since the COVID pandemic. Obviously, I know the Americas as I just touched on is a little bit softer than China, which you cleared up earlier. But how do you think about the differences in sort of the macro conditions by region? And again, do you have a sense for are we nearing a trough from a macro demand perspective or how long do you think this particular weakness persists? Thanks.
Tim Cook: Let me take the first part of your question about America. If you look at the U.S., which obviously drives the vast, vast majority of the revenue in America, we grew in the December quarter from an iPhone business point of view and the install base hit an all-time high. If you look at the replacement cycle, it's very difficult to measure the replacement cycle at any given point. And so, what we focus on internally a lot is the active install base and the -- obviously, the sales over usually a cycle and we feel better about those things. If you look at the -- who's selling what in the U.S., the iPhone is four out of the top five selling smartphones in the US. And of course, the customer satisfaction in the U.S. as we alluded to earlier is 99%. So we feel very, very good about what our position is in the U.S.
Luca Maestri: And I would add to that, keep in mind, obviously, the extra week that we had a year ago that obviously makes the compare more -- a bit distorted. On the March quarter guide, I would point to you that, obviously, the COVID years had a lot of, let's say, turmoil in it, a lot of volatility that typically you wouldn't see. If you look at our sequential progression from December to March this year versus pre-COVID versus like a more normal environment, it's actually stronger than those years.
David Vogt: Got it. Thanks, guys.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, David. Operator, can we have the last question, please?
Operator: Thank you. Our last question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Ben Reitzes: Yes. Hi. Thanks. Appreciate it. Two questions, if I can sneak them in. Just wanted to clarify on China. Tim, I think last quarter you still thought it was a growth market. Obviously, there's some concerns with the -- recently and given what we saw in the quarter, is there something that we can kind of point to where you feel that that market can resume growth in the future? And I'm wondering if you're still upbeat about that prospect. And then I just have a quick follow up.
Tim Cook: Ben, we've been in China for 30 years. And I remain very optimistic about China over the long term. And I feel good about hitting a new install base number, high watermark and very good about the growth in upgraders year-over-year during the quarter.
Ben Reitzes: Great. Thanks Tim. And just in terms of AI, I know you're not going to talk about your plans, but do you believe -- are you a believer in the edge thesis that AI and processing on smartphones and devices like yours is going to have a huge role in AI and AI apps and that it's something you guys can take advantage of.
Tim Cook: Let me just say that, I think there's a huge opportunity for Apple with GenAI and AI. And without getting into to more details and getting out in front of myself.
Ben Reitzes: Thanks Tim.
Tim Cook: Yes, Thanks, Ben.
Suhasini Chandramouli: All right. Thank you Ben. A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks on Apple Podcasts, as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone.

Operator: Once again, this does conclude today's conference. We do appreciate your participation.",2024-02-01
AAPL,2024,2,2024-Q2-AAPL,"Suhasini Chandramouli: Good Afternoon, and welcome to the Apple Q2 Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Suhasini Chandramouli, Director of Investor Relations. Today's call is being recorded. Speaking first today is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook, including the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions on the company's business and results of operations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.
Tim Cook: Thank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $90.8 billion and an EPS record of $1.53 for the March quarter. We set revenue records in more than a dozen countries and regions. These include, among others, March quarter records in Latin-America and the Middle East, as well as Canada, India, Spain and Turkey. We also achieved an all-time revenue record in Indonesia, one of the many markets where we continue to see so much potential. In services, we set an all-time revenue record, up 14% over the past year. Keep in mind, as we described on the last call, in the March quarter a year-ago, we were able to replenish iPhone channel inventory and fulfill significant pent-up demand from the December quarter COVID-related supply disruptions on the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max. We estimate this one-time impact added close to $5 billion to the March quarter revenue last year. If we remove this from last year's results, our March quarter total company revenue this year would have grown. Despite this impact, we were still able to deliver the records I described. Of course, this past quarter, we were thrilled to launch Apple Vision Pro and it has been so wonderful to hear from people who now get to experience the magic of spatial computing. They describe the impossible becoming possible right before their eyes and they share their amazement and their emotions about what they can do now, whether it's reliving their most treasured memories or having a movie theater experience right in their living room. It's also great to see the enthusiasm from the enterprise market. For example, more than half of the Fortune 100 companies have already bought Apple Vision Pro units and are exploring innovative ways to use it to do things that weren't possible before, and this is just the beginning. Looking ahead, we're getting ready for an exciting product announcement next week that we think our customers will love. And next month, we have our Worldwide Developers Conference, which has generated enormous enthusiasm from our developers. We can't wait to reveal what we have in-store. We continue to feel very bullish about our opportunity in Generative AI. We are making significant investments, and we're looking forward to sharing some very exciting things with our customers soon. We believe in the transformative power and promise of AI, and we believe we have advantages that will differentiate us in this new era, including Apple's unique combination of seamless hardware, software and services integration, groundbreaking Apple's silicon, with our industry-leading neural engines and our unwavering focus on privacy, which underpins everything we create. As we push innovation forward, we continue to manage thoughtfully and deliberately through an uneven macroeconomic environment and remain focused on putting our users at the center of everything we do. Now let's turn to our results for the March quarter across each product category, beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenue for the March quarter was $46 billion, down 10% year-over-year. We faced a difficult compare over the previous year due to the $5 billion impact that I mentioned earlier. However, we still saw growth on iPhone in some markets, including Mainland China, and according to Kantar during the quarter, the two best-selling smartphones in Urban China were the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro Max. I was in China recently where I had the chance to meet with developers and creators who are doing remarkable things with iPhone. And just a couple of weeks ago, I visited Vietnam, Indonesia and Singapore, where it was incredible to see all the ways customers and communities are using our products and services to do amazing things. Everywhere I travel, people have such a great affinity for Apple, and it's one of the many reasons I'm so optimistic about the future. Turning to Mac. March quarter revenue was $7.5 billion, up 4% from a year ago. We had an amazing launch in early March with the new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air. The world's most popular laptop is the best consumer laptop for AI with breakthrough performance of the M3 chip and it’s even more powerful neural engine. Whether it's an entrepreneur starting a new business or a college student finishing their degree, users depend on the power and portability of MacBook Air to take them places they couldn't have gone without it. In iPad, revenue for the March quarter was $5.6 billion, 17% lower year-over-year, due to a difficult compare with the momentum following the launch of M2 iPad Pro and the 10th Generation iPad last fiscal year. iPad continues to stand apart for its versatility, power and performance. For video editors, music makers and creatives of all kinds, iPad is empowering users to do more than they ever could with a tablet. Across Wearables, Home and Accessories, March quarter revenue was $7.9 billion, down 10% from a year-ago due to a difficult launch compare on Watch and AirPods. Apple Watch is helping runners go the extra mile on their wellness journeys, keeping hikers on course with the latest navigation capabilities in watchOS 10, and enabling users of all fitness levels to live a healthier day. Across our watch lineup, we're harnessing AI and machine-learning to power lifesaving features like a regular rhythm notifications and fall detection. I often hear about how much these features mean to users and their loved ones and I'm thankful that so many people are able to get help in their time of greatest need. As I shared earlier, we set an all-time revenue record in services with $23.9 billion, up 14% year-over-year. We also achieved all-time revenue records across several categories and geographic segments. Audiences are tuning in on screens large, small and spatial and are enjoying Apple TV+ Originals like Palm Royale and Sugar. And we have some incredible theatrical releases coming this year, including Wolves, which reunites George Clooney and Brad Pitt. Apple TV+ productions continue to be celebrated as major awards contenders. Since launch, Apple TV+ productions have earned more than 2,100 award nominations and 480 wins. Meanwhile, we're enhancing the live sports experience with a new iPhone app, Apple Sports. This free app allows fans to follow their favorite teams and leagues with real-time scores, stats and more. Apple Sports is the perfect companion for MLS Season Pass subscribers. Turning to retail, our stores continued to be vital spaces for connection and innovation. I was delighted to be in Shanghai for the opening of our latest flagship store. The energy and enthusiasm from our customers was truly something to behold. And across the United States, our incredible retail teams have been sharing Vision Pro demos with customers, delighting them with a profound and emotional experience of using it for the very first time. Everywhere we operate and everything we do, we're guided by our mission to enrich users' lives and lead the world better than we found it, whether we're making Apple podcasts more accessible with a new transcripts feature or helping to safeguard iMessage users' privacy with new protections that can defend against advances in quantum computing. Our environmental work is another great example of how innovation and our values come together. As we work toward our goal of being carbon-neutral across all of our products by 2030, we are proud of how we've been able to innovate and do more for our customers while taking less from the planet. Since 2015, Apple has cut our overall emissions by more than half, while revenue grew nearly 65% during that same time period. And we're now using more recycled materials in our products than ever before. Earlier this spring, we launched our first-ever product to use 50% recycled materials with a new M3-powered MacBook Air. We're also investing in new solar and wind power in the U.S. and Europe, both to power our growing operations and our users' devices. And we're working with partners in India and the U.S. to replenish 100% of the water we use in places that need it most with the goal of delivering billions of gallons of water benefits over the next two decades. Through our Restore Fund, Apple has committed $200 million to nature-based carbon removal projects. And last month, we welcomed two supplier partners as new investors, who will together invest up to an additional $80 million in the fund. Whether we're enriching lives of users across the globe or doing our part to be a force for good in the world, we do everything with a deep sense of purpose at Apple. And I'm proud of the impact we've already made at the halfway point in a year of unprecedented innovation. I couldn't be more excited for the future we have ahead of us, driven by the imagination and innovation of our teams and the enduring importance of our products and services in people's lives. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.
Luca Maestri: Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the March quarter was $90.8 billion, down 4% from last year. Foreign exchange had a negative year-over-year impact of 140 basis points on our results. Products revenue was $66.9 billion, down 10% year-over-year due to the challenging compare on iPhone that Tim described earlier, which was partially offset by strength from Mac. And thanks to our unparalleled customer satisfaction and loyalty and a high number of customers who are new to our products, our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and all geographic segments. Services revenue set an all-time record of $23.9 billion, up 14% year-over-year with record performance in both developed and emerging markets. Company gross margin was 46.6%, up 70 basis points sequentially, driven by cost savings and favorable mix to services, partially offset by leverage. Products gross margin was 36.6%, down 280 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by seasonal loss of leverage and mix, partially offset by favorable costs. Services gross margin was 74.6%, up 180 basis points from last quarter due to a more favorable mix. Operating expenses of $14.4 billion were at the midpoint of the guidance range we provided and up 5% year-over-year. Net income was $23.6 billion, diluted EPS was $1.53 and a March quarter record, and operating cash flow was strong at $22.7 billion. Let me now provide more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $46 billion, down 10% year-over-year, due to the almost $5 billion impact from a year ago that Tim described earlier. Adjusting for this one-time impact, iPhone revenue would be roughly flat to last year. Our iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high in total and in every geographic segment. And during the March quarter, we saw many iPhone models as the top-selling smartphones around the world. In fact, according to a survey from Kantar, an iPhone was the top-selling model in the U.S., Urban China, Australia, the U.K., France, Germany and Japan. And the iPhone 15 family continues to be very popular with customers. 451 Research recently measured customer satisfaction at 99% in the U.S. Mac revenue was $7.5 billion, up 4% year-over-year, driven by the strength of our new MacBook Air, powered by the M3 chip. Customers are loving the incredible AI performance of the latest MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models. And our Mac installed base reached an all-time high with half of our MacBook Air buyers during the quarter being new to Mac. Also customer satisfaction for Mac was recently reported at 96% in the U.S. iPad generated $5.6 billion in revenue, down 17% year-over-year. iPad continued to face a challenging compare against the launch of the M2 iPad Pro and iPad 10th Generation from last year. At the same time, the iPad installed base has continued to grow and is at an all-time high as over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product. In addition, the latest reports from 451 Research indicated customer satisfaction of 96% for iPad in the US. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $7.9 billion, down 10% year-over-year due to a difficult launch compare. Last year, we had the continued benefit from the launches of the AirPods Pro second-generation, the Watch SE and the first Watch Ultra. Apple Watch continues to attract new customers, with almost two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product, sending the Apple Watch installed base to a new all-time high and customer satisfaction was recently measured at 95% in the U.S. In services, as I mentioned, total revenue reached an all-time record of $23.9 billion, growing 14% year-over-year with our installed-base of active devices continuing to grow at a nice pace. This provides a strong foundation for the future growth of the services business as we continued to see increased customer engagement with our ecosystem. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts reached a new all-time high with paid accounts growing double-digits year-over-year. And paid subscriptions showed strong double-digit growth. We have well over $1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, more than double the number that we had only four years ago. We continued to improve the breadth and quality of our current services from creating new games on Arcade and great new shows on TV+ to launching additional countries and partners for Apple Pay. Turning to enterprise, our customers continued to invest in Apple products to drive productivity and innovation. We see more and more enterprise customers embracing the Mac. In Healthcare, Epic Systems, the world's largest electronic medical record provider, recently launched its native app for the Mac, making it easier for healthcare organizations like Emory Health to transition thousands of PCs to the Mac for clinical use. And since the launch of Vision Pro last quarter, many leading enterprise customers have been investing in this amazing new product to bring spatial computing apps and experiences to life. We are seeing so many compelling use cases from aircraft engine maintenance training at KLM Airlines to real-time team collaboration for racing at Porsche to immersive kitchen design at Lowe's. We couldn't be more excited about the spatial computing opportunity in enterprise. Taking a quick step back, when we look at our performance during the first-half of our fiscal year, total company revenue was roughly flat to the prior year in spite of having one less week of sales during the period and some foreign exchange headwinds. We were particularly pleased with our strong momentum in emerging markets, as we set first-half revenue records in several countries and regions, including Latin-America, the Middle East, India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Turkey. These results, coupled with double-digit growth in services and strong levels of gross margin, drove a first half diluted EPS record of $3.71, up 9% from last year. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $162 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $3.2 billion in maturing debt and commercial paper was unchanged sequentially, leaving us with total debt of $105 billion. As a result, net cash was $58 billion at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, we returned over $27 billion to shareholders, including $3.7 billion in dividends and equivalents and $23.5 billion through open-market repurchases of $130 million Apple's shares. Given the continued confidence we have in our business now and into the future, our Board has authorized today an additional $110 billion for share repurchases, as we maintain our goal of getting to net cash-neutral over time. We are also raising our dividend by 4% to $0.25 per share of common stock, and we continued to plan for annual increases in the dividend going forward as we've done for the last 12 years. This cash dividend will be payable on May 16, 2024 to shareholders of record as of May 13, 2024. As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we are providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. We expect our June quarter total company revenue to grow low-single-digits year-over-year in spite of a foreign exchange headwind of about 2.5 percentage points. We expect our services business to grow double-digits at a rate similar to the growth we reported for the first-half of the fiscal year. And we expect iPad revenue to grow double-digits. We expect gross margin to be between 45.5% to -- and 46.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $14.3 billion and $14.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be around $50 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%. With that, let's open the call to questions.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?
Operator: Certainly. We will go ahead and take our first question from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Mike Ng: Hey, good afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. I have two, first, I'll ask about the June quarter guidance. The revenue outlook for low-single digits growth, I was wondering if you could run through some of the product assumptions, iPhone, like what kind of gives you confidence around that? And then on the service momentum, what was better than expected in the quarter? And then I just have a quick follow-up.
Luca Maestri: Hey, Mike. It's Luca. On the outlook, what we said is we expect to grow low-single-digits in total for the company. We expect services to grow double-digits at a rate that is similar to what we've done in the first-half of our fiscal year. And we've also mentioned that iPad should grow double-digits. This is the color that we're providing for the June quarter. In services, we've seen a very strong performance across the board. We've mentioned, we've had records in several categories, in several geographic segments. It's very broad based, our subscription business is going well. Transacting accounts and paid accounts are growing double-digits. And also we've seen a really strong performance both in developed and emerging markets. So very pleased with the way the services business is going.
Mike Ng: Great. Thank you. And I wanted to ask about, as Apple leans more into AI and Generative AI, should we expect any changes to the historical CapEx cadence that we've seen in the last few years of about $10 billion to $11 billion per year or any changes to, you know, how we may have historically thought about the split between tooling, data center and facilities? Thank you very much.
Luca Maestri: Yes. We are obviously very excited about the opportunity with Gen AI. We obviously are pushing very hard on innovation on every front and we've been doing that for many, many years. Just during the last five years, we spent more than a $100 billion in research and development. As you know, on the CapEx front, we have a bit of a hybrid model where we make some of the investments ourselves. In other cases, we share them with our suppliers and partners on the manufacturing side, we purchased some of the tools and manufacturing equipment. In some of the cases, our suppliers make the investment. On the -- and we do something similar on the data center side. We have our own data center capacity and then we use capacity from third parties. It's a model that has worked well for us historically and we plan to continue along the same lines going forward.
Mike Ng: Excellent. Thank you very much.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Awesome. Thank you, Mike. Operator, can we have the next question, please?
Operator: Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Wamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you so much. Tim, can you talk about the implications to Apple from the changes driven by EU DMA? You've had to open up third-party app stores, clearly disposes some security risks on the one-hand, which can dilute the experience, but also lower payments from developers to Apple. What are you seeing developers choose in these early days and consumers choose in terms of these third-party app stores? And I have a follow-up.
Tim Cook: It's really too early to answer the question. We just implemented in March, as you probably know, in the European Union, the alternate app stores and alternate billing, et cetera. So we're focused on complying while mitigating the impacts to user privacy and security that you mentioned. And so that's our focus.
Wamsi Mohan: Okay. Thank you, Tim. And Luca, I was wondering if you could comment a bit on the product gross margins, the sequential step down. You noted both mix and leverage. Any more color on the mix, if you could share if customers are at all starting to mix down across product lines or is this more a mix across product lines? Just trying to get some color on customer behavior given some of the broader inflationary pressures. Thank you so much.
Luca Maestri: On a sequential basis, yes, we were down. It's primarily the fact that we had a slightly different mix of products than the previous one. Obviously, leverage plays a big role as we move from the holiday quarter into the -- into, you know, a more typical quarter. So I would say primarily leverage in a different mix of products. I mean, we haven't seen anything different in terms within the product categories, we haven't seen anything particular.
Wamsi Mohan: Thank you so much.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Wamsi. We'll take the next question, please.
Operator: Our next question is from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Erik Woodring: Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Maybe my first one, Tim, you've obviously mentioned your excitement around Generative AI multiple times. I'm just curious how Apple is thinking about the different ways in which you can monetize this technology because historically software upgrades haven't been a big factor in driving product cycles. And so could AI be potentially different? And how could that impact replacement cycles? Is there any services angle you'd be thinking? Any early color that you can share on that? And then I have a follow up, please. Thanks.
Tim Cook: I don't want to get in front of our announcements, obviously. I would just say that we see Generative AI as a very key opportunity across our products. And we believe that we have advantages that set us apart there. And we'll be talking more about it in as we go through the weeks ahead.
Erik Woodring: Okay. Very fair. Thank you. And then Luca, maybe to just follow up on Wamsi's comments or question. There's a broad concern about the headwind that rising commodity costs have on your product gross margins. Wondering if you could just clarify for us if we take a step back and look at all of the components and commodities that go into your products kind of collectively, are we -- are you seeing these costs rising? Are they falling? What tools do you have to try to help and mitigate some rising costs if at all, rising input costs if at all? Thank you so much.
Luca Maestri: Yes. I mean during the last quarter, commodity costs, and in general, component costs have behaved favorably to us. On the memory front, prices are starting to go up. They've gone up slightly during the March quarter. But in general, I think it's been a period not only this quarter, but the last several quarters where, you know, commodities have behaved well for us. Commodities going cycles and so there's obviously always that possibility. Keep in mind that we are starting from a very high level of gross margins. We reported 46.6%, which is something that we haven't seen in our company in decades. And so we're starting from a good point. As you know, we try to buy ahead when the cycles are favorable to us. And so we will try to mitigate if there are headwinds. But in general, we feel particularly for this cycle, we are in good shape.
Erik Woodring: Thank you so much.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Great. Thank you, Erik. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.
Operator: Our next question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius. Please go ahead.
Ben Reitzes: Hey, thanks for the question. And hey, Tim, I was wondering if I could ask the China question again. Is there any more color from your visit there that gives you confidence that you've reached a bottom there and that it's turning? And I know you've been -- you've continued to be confident there in the long-term. Just wondering if there was any color as to when you think that the tide turns there? Thanks a lot. And I have a follow-up.
Tim Cook: Yes, Ben, if you look at our results in Q2 for Greater China, we were down 8%. That's an acceleration from the previous quarter in Q1. And the primary driver of the acceleration was iPhone. And if you then look at iPhone within Mainland China, we grew on a reported basis. That's before any kind of normalization for the supply disruption that we mentioned earlier. And if you look at the top-selling smartphones, the Top 2 in Urban China are iPhones. And while I was there, it was a great visit and we opened a new store in Shanghai and the reception was very warm and highly energetic, and so I left there having a fantastic trip and enjoyed being there. And so I maintain a great view of China in the long-term. I don't know how each and every quarter goes and each and every week. But over the long haul, I have a very positive viewpoint.
Ben Reitzes: Okay. Hey, thanks, Tim. And then my follow-up, I want to ask this carefully though. It's a -- there's a fear out there that, you may lose some traffic acquisition revenue. And I was wondering if you thought AI from big picture and it doesn't have to be on a long-term basis, I mean from a big picture, if AI is an opportunity for you to continue to monetize your mobile real estate, just how you -- how maybe investors can think about that from a big picture, just given that's been one of the concerns that's potentially been an overhang, of course, due to, you know, a lot of the news and the media around some of the legal cases? And I was wondering if there's just a big-picture color you could give that makes us kind of think about it better and your ability to sort of continue to monetize that real estate? Thanks a lot.
Tim Cook: I think AI, Generative AI and AI, both are big opportunities for us across our products. And we'll talk more about it in the coming weeks. I think there are numerous ways there that are great for us. And we think that we're well-positioned.
Ben Reitzes: Thanks, Tim.
Tim Cook: Yes.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Ben. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Krish Sankar: Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. Again, sorry to beat the AI haul. But Tim, I know you don't want to like reveal a lot. But I'm just kind of curious, because last quarter you spoke about how you're getting traction in enterprise. Is the AI strategy going to be both consumer and enterprise or is it going to be one after the other? Any color would be helpful? And then, I have a follow-up for Luca.
Tim Cook: Our focus on enterprise has been and you know through the quarter and the quarters that preceded it on selling iPhones and iPads and Macs and we recently added Vision Pro to that. And we're thrilled with what we see there in terms of interest from big companies buying some to explore ways they can use it. And so I see enormous opportunity in the enterprise. I wouldn't want to cabin that to AI only. I think there's a great opportunity for us around the world in the enterprise.
Krish Sankar: Got it. Very helpful. And then for Luca, you know, I'm kind of curious on -- given the macro-environment, on the hardware side, are you seeing a bias towards like standard iPhone versus the Pro model? The reason I'm asking the question is that there's a weaker consumer spending environment, yet your services business is still growing and has amazing gross margins. So I'm just trying to like square the circle over there. Thank you.
Luca Maestri: I'm not sure I fully understand the question, but in general, what we are seeing on the product side, we continued to see a lot of interest at the top of the range of our products. And I think it's a combination of consumers wanting to purchase the best product that we offer in the different categories and our ability to make those purchases more affordable over time. We've introduced several financing solutions from installment plans to trading programs that reduce the affordability threshold and therefore, customers tend to buy -- want to buy at the top of the range that is very valuable for us in developed markets, but particularly in emerging markets where the affordability issues are more pronounced. But in general, over the last several years and that is also reflected in our gross margins, over the last several years, we've seen this trend, which we think is pretty sustainable.
Krish Sankar: Got it. Thank you very much, Luca, and thanks, Tim.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Krish. Operator, we'll have the next question, please.
Operator: Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Amit Daryanani: Thanks for taking my question. I have two as well. You know, I guess, first off on capital allocation, you folks have about $58 billion of net cash right now. As you think about eventually getting to this net cash-neutral target, do you think at some point, Apple would be open to taking on leverage on the balance sheet and continuing the buyback program? Or is it more like once you get to this neutral position, it's going to be about returning free cash flow back to shareholders? I'm just wondering, how do you think about leverage on your balance sheet over time and what sort of leverage do you think you'd be comfortable taking on?
Luca Maestri: Hey, Amit. This is Luca. I would say one step at a time, we have put out this target of getting to net cash-neutral several years ago and we're working very hard to get there. Our free cash flow generation has been very strong over the years, particularly in the last few years. And so as you've seen this year, we've increased the amount that we're allocating to the buyback. For the last couple of years, we were doing $90 billion, now we're doing $110 billion. So let's get there first. It's going to take a while still. And then when we are there, we're going to reassess and see what is the optimal capital structure for the company at that point in time. Obviously, there's going to be a number of considerations that we will need to look at when we get there.
Amit Daryanani: Fair enough. I figure it's worth trying anyway. If I go back to this China discussion a bit and, you know, Tim, I think your comments around growth in iPhones in Mainland China is really notable. Could you step back, I mean, these numbers are still declining at least Greater China on a year-over-year basis in aggregate. Maybe just talk about what are you seeing from a macro basis in China and then at least annual decline -- or year-over-year declines that we're seeing. Do you think it's more macro driven or more competitive driven over there? That would be helpful.
Tim Cook: Yes, I can only tell you what we're seeing. And so I don't want to present myself as a economist. So I'll steer clear of that. From what we saw was an acceleration from Q1, and it was driven by iPhone and iPhone in Mainland China before we adjust for this $5 billion impact that we talked about earlier did grow. That means the other products didn't fare as well. And so we clearly have work there to do. I think it has been and is through last quarter, the most competitive market in the world. And I -- so I, you know, wouldn't say anything other than that. I've said that before, and I believe that it was last quarter as well. And -- but if you step back from the 90-day cycle, what I see is a lot of people moving into the middle class, a -- we try to serve customers very well there and have a lot of happy customers and you can kind of see that in the latest store opening over there. And so I continue to feel very optimistic.
Amit Daryanani: Great. Thank you.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Amit. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.
Operator: Our next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.
David Vogt: Great. Thanks guys for taking my question. I'm going to roll the two together, so you guys have them both. So Luca obviously, I'm trying to parse through the outlook for the June quarter. And just based on the quick math, it looks like all things being equal, given what you said, the iPhone business is going to be down mid-single-digits again in the June quarter. And if that's the case and maybe this is for Tim obviously, how are you thinking about the competitive landscape in the context of what you just said maybe outside of China and what changes sort of, the consumer demand or receptivity to new devices because we've been in this malaise for a while. Is it really this AI initiative that a lot of companies are pursuing? And do you think that changes sort of the demand drivers going forward? Or is it just really more of a timing issue in terms of the replacement cycle is a little bit long in the tooth, and we see a bit of an upgrade cycle at some point, maybe later this year into next year? Thanks.
Tim Cook: I do see a key opportunity, as I've mentioned before with Generative AI with all of our devices or the vast majority of our devices. And so I think that if you look out that that's not within the next quarter or so and we don't guide at the product level, but I'm extremely optimistic. And so that -- that's kind of how I view it. In terms of the -- I'll let Luca comment on the outlook portion of it. I think if you step back on iPhone though and you make this adjustment from the previous year, our Q2 results would be flattish on iPhone. And so that's how we performed in Q2.
Luca Maestri: Yes, David, on the outlook, I'll only repeat what we said before, and this is the color that we're providing for the quarter. We do expect to grow in total, low-single-digits. And we do expect services to grow double-digits, and we expect iPad to grow double-digits for the rest. I'll let you make assumptions and then we will report three months from now.
David Vogt: Great. Thanks guys. I'll get back in the queue.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, David. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.
Operator: Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Samik Chatterjee: Hi, thanks for taking my question, and I have a couple as well. Maybe for the first one, your services growth accelerated from 11% growth to 14%. If you can sort of dig into the drivers of where or which parts of services did you really see that acceleration? And why it isn't a bit more sustainable as we think about the next quarter? Because I believe you're guiding more to sort of averaging out the first half of the year for the next quarter. So just curious what were the drivers and why not have it a bit more sustainably sort of improve as we go through the remainder of the year? And I have a quick follow-up. Thank you.
Luca Maestri: So a number of things on services. First of all, the overall performance was very strong. As I said earlier, all-time records in both developed and emerging markets. So we see our services do well across the world. Records in many of our services categories. There are some categories that are growing very fast also because they are relatively smaller in the scheme of our services business like cloud, video, payment services. You know, those all set all-time revenue records. And so we feel very good about the progress that we're making in services. As we go forward, I'll just point out that if you look at our growth rates a year ago, they improved during the course of the fiscal year last year. So the comps for the services business become a bit more challenging as we go through the year. But in general, as I mentioned, we still expect to grow double-digits in the June quarter at a rate that is very similar to what we've done in the first half.
Samik Chatterjee: Got it. Got it. And for my follow up, if I can ask you more specifically about the India market. Obviously, you continue to make new records in terms of revenue in that market. How much of the momentum you're seeing would you associate with your sort of retail strategy in that market, retail expansion relative to maybe some of the supply change or the sort of manufacturing changes or strategy you've undergone or taken in that market itself. Any thoughts around that would be helpful?
Tim Cook: Sure. We did grow strong double-digit. And so we were very, very pleased about it. It was a new March quarter revenue record for us. As you know, as I've said before, I see it as an incredibly exciting market and it's a major focus for us. In terms of the operational side or supply chain side, we are producing there, from a pragmatic point of view, you need to produce there to be competitive. And so yes, there the two things are linked from that point of view. But we have both operational things going on and we have go-to-market, and initiatives going on. We just opened a couple of stores as last year, as you know, and we see enormous opportunity there. We're continuing to expand our channels, and also working on the developer ecosystem as well. And we've been very pleased that there is a rapidly-growing base of developers there. And so, we're working all of the entire ecosystem from developer to the market to operations, the whole thing. And I just -- I could not be more excited and enthusiastic about it.
Samik Chatterjee: Got it. Thank you. Thanks for that.
Tim Cook: Yes.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Samik. Operator, we'll have the next question, please.
Operator: Our next question is from. Please go ahead.
Aaron Rakers: Yes, thanks for taking the questions, and I think I have to have two as well like everybody else. I guess, I'm going to go back to the China question. I guess, at a high level, the simple question is, when we look at the data points that have been repeatedly reported throughout the course of this quarter, I'm curious, Tim, you know, what are we missing? Like where do you think people are missing, Apple's iPhone traction within the China market, just at a high level, you know, given the data points that were reported throughout this course of the last quarter?
Tim Cook: I can't address the data points. I can only address what our results are. And we did accelerate last quarter, and the iPhone grew in Mainland China. So that's what the results were. I can't bridge to numbers we didn't come up with.
Aaron Rakers: Okay. And then as a quick follow-up, I know you guys haven't talked about this, you know, quantified it in quite some time. But I'm curious how we would characterize the channel inventory dynamics for iPhone?
Tim Cook: Sure. The -- for the March quarter, we decreased channel inventory during the quarter. We usually decreased channel inventory during the Q2 timeframe. So that's not unusual. And we're very comfortable with the overall channel inventory.
Aaron Rakers: Thank you.
Tim Cook: Yes.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Aaron. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.
Operator: Our next question is from Richard Kramer with Arete Research. Please go ahead.
Richard Kramer: Thanks very much. I'm not going to ask about China, but you regularly call out all the rapid growth in many other emerging markets. So is Apple approaching a point where all of those other emerging markets in aggregate might crossover to become larger than your current $70 billion Greater China segments, and maybe investors could look at that for driving growth for the wider business? And then I have a follow-up for Luca. Thanks.
Luca Maestri: I think, Richard, you're asking a really interesting question. We were looking at something similar recently. Obviously, China is by far the largest emerging market that we have. But when we started looking at places like India, like Saudi, like Mexico, Turkey, of course, Brazil and Mexico and Indonesia, the numbers are getting large, and we're very happy because these are markets where our market share is low, the populations are large and growing. And our products are really making a lot of progress with the -- in those markets. The level of excitement for the brand is very high. Tim was in Southeast Asia recently, and the level of excitement is incredibly high. So it is very good for us. And then -- and certainly, the numbers are getting larger all the time. And so the gap as you compare it to the numbers in China is reducing, and hopefully, that trajectory continues for a long time.
Richard Kramer: Okay. And then as a follow-up, maybe for either of you, I mean, you're coming up on four years from what was incredibly popular iPhone 12 cycle. And, you know, given you're struggling to reduce your net -- your -- reach your net neutral cash position and your margins are sort of near highs, do you see ways to deploy capital more to spur replacement demand in your installed base either with greater device financing, more investment in marketing, more promotions. I mean, do you feel like you needed to produce those sort of margins or is it a more important to spur growth with replacement? Thanks.
Tim Cook: I think innovation spurs the upgrade cycle, and as one thing, of course, there's economic factors as well that play in there. And what kind of offerings there are from our carrier partners and so forth. And so there's a number of variables in there. But we work all of those, and you know, we price our products for the value that we're delivering. And so that's how we look at it.
Luca Maestri: And if I can add to Tim's comments, Richard, one of the things that when you look over the long arc of time that maybe is not fully understood is that we've gone through a long period of very strong dollar. And what that means given that our company sells more than 60% of our revenue is outside the United States. The demand for our products in those markets is stronger than the results that we report just because of the translation of those local currencies into dollars, right? And so that is something to keep in mind as you look at our results, right? And so we are making all the investments that are needed and Tim has talked about innovation. Obviously, we made a lot of progress with financing solutions, with trading programs and so on, and we will continue to make all those investments.
Richard Kramer: Okay. Super. Thanks, guys.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Richard. Operator, can we take our last question, please.
Operator: Our next question is from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead.
Atif Malik: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions, and I have two questions as well. First for Tim, for enterprise, specifically, what are some of the top two or three use cases on Vision Pro you're hearing most excitement? And then I have a follow-up for Luca.
Tim Cook: Yes, the great thing is, I'm hearing about so many of them. I wouldn't say that one has emerged as the top, right now. The most impressive thing is that similar to the way people use a Mac, you use it for everything. People are using it for many different things in enterprise, and that varies from field service to training to healthcare related things like preparing a doctor for pre-op surgery or advanced imaging. And so the -- it commands control centers. And so it's an enormous number of different verticals. And you know our focus is on -- is growing that ecosystem and getting more apps and more and more enterprises engaged. And the event that we had recently, I can't overstate the enthusiasm in the room. It was extraordinary. And so we're off to a good start, I think, with the enterprise.
Atif Malik: Great. And then Luca, I believe you mentioned that for the March quarter, the commodity pricing environment was favorable. Can you talk about what you're assuming for commodity pricing on memory and et cetera for the June quarter and maybe for the full-year?
Luca Maestri: Yes, we provide guidance just for the current quarter. So I'll tell you about the, you know, the guidance. We're guiding to again to a very high level of gross margins, 45.5% to 46.5%. Within that guidance, we expect memory to be a slight headwind, not a very large one, but a slight headwind. And the same applies for foreign exchange. Foreign exchange will have a negative impact sequentially of about 30 basis points.
Atif Malik: Thank you.

AAPL,2024,3,2024-Q3-AAPL,"Suhasini Chandramouli: Good afternoon and welcome to the Apple Q3 Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Suhasini Chandramouli, Director of Investor Relations. Today's call is being recorded. Speaking first today is Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook including the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions on the company's business and results of operations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date they are made. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.
Tim Cook : Thank you Suhasini. Good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting a new June quarter revenue record of $85.8 billion, up 5% from a year ago and better than we had expected. EPS grew double digits to $1.40 and achieved a record for the June quarter. We also set quarterly revenue records in more than two dozen countries and regions, including Canada, Mexico, France, Germany, the UK, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand. And we set an all-time revenue record in services which grew 14%. At our Worldwide Developers Conference, we were thrilled to unveil game-changing updates across our platforms, including Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence builds on years of innovation and investment in AI and Machine Learning. It will transform how users interact with technology, from writing tools to help you express yourself, to image playground, which gives you the ability to create fun images and communicate in new ways, to powerful tools for summarizing and prioritizing notifications. Siri also becomes more natural, more useful, and more personal than ever. Apple Intelligence is built on a foundation of privacy, both through on-device processing that does not collect users' data and through private cloud compute, a groundbreaking new approach to using the cloud, while protecting users' information powered by Apple silicon. We are also integrating ChatGPT into experiences within iPhone, Mac, and iPad, enabling users to draw on a broad base of world knowledge. We are very excited about Apple Intelligence and we remain incredibly optimistic about the extraordinary possibilities of AI and its ability to enrich customers' lives. We will continue to make significant investments in this technology and dedicate ourselves to the innovation that will unlock its full potential. Recently, we've also been excited to bring Apple Vision Pro to more countries, giving customers the chance to discover the remarkable capabilities of this magical device. Vision Pro users are customizing their own workspaces, watching movies on 100-foot screens, and exploring entire worlds with just a pinch of their fingertips. With more than 2,500 native spatial apps and 1.5 million compatible apps for Vision OS, the developer community continues to pioneer stunning spatial experiences that are only possible with Vision Pro. Last month, we announced that we're bringing some amazing new immersive content to Vision Pro, including new series, concerts, films, and more. And we've seen great interest for Vision Pro in the enterprise, where it can empower companies large and small to pursue their best ideas like never before. With each innovation, we're unlocking new ways of working, new ways of learning, and new ways of tapping into the unlimited promise of human potential. We are doing that across every product and every service. Now let me share more detail in our June quarter results, beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenue was $39.3 billion, down 1% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, we grew compared to last year. Customers continue to praise the iPhone 15 lineup for its incredible battery life, exceptional cameras, and unmatched power and performance. And we are excited to bring incredible new features to the iPhone with iOS 18, making it more personal, capable, and intelligent than ever before. This update includes the biggest redesign of the Photos app, new customization options for the home screen, messages over satellite, and the introduction of Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence utilizes the power of our most advanced iPhones, the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, offering a transformative set of capabilities. Mac revenue was $7 billion, up 2% from a year ago. Customers are loving the latest M3-powered 13 and 15 inch MacBook Air. With back-to-school season upon us, MacBook Air is the perfect companion for students on campus and small business owners, developers, and creatives of all kinds depend on Mac to do more than they ever could before. Powered by Apple silicon with its neural engine and privacy built in at the chip level, Macs are simply the best personal computers for AI. And every Mac we've shipped with Apple silicon since 2020, is capable of taking advantage of Apple Intelligence with Mac OS Sequoia. We also know the importance of security for our users and enterprises so we continue to advance protections across our products. Turning to iPad, revenue was $7.2 billion, 24% higher year-over-year. During the quarter, we had an incredible launch where we unveiled the all-new 11 and 13 inch iPad Air, the perfect device for education, entertainment, and so much more. And With the new iPad Pro, we pushed the boundaries of power-efficient performance with the remarkable M4 chip, the engine behind this incredibly thin device. By leveraging the latest in Apple silicon, Video Editors and Musicians can take advantage of the cutting edge AI features in Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro. And we're very excited that iPad Pro and iPad Air models powered by the M series of Apple silicon will be able to utilize the powerful capabilities of Apple Intelligence. In wearables, home, and accessories, revenue was $8.1 billion, down 2% from a year ago. Apple Watch is empowering users to live a healthier day with a range of tools to take charge of their wellness journeys. At the core of Apple Watch, are powerful AI features that are helping users get help when they need it most, from irregular heart rhythm notifications to walking steadiness to crash detection and fall detection. I've heard time and again how meaningful these features are for users and their loved ones, and their stories motivate us to keep pushing forward on this vital work. As I mentioned earlier, in services, we set an all-time revenue record of $24.2 billion with paid subscriptions climbing to an all-time high. We achieve revenue records in the majority of the services categories with all-time revenue records in advertising, cloud, and payment services. Apple TV+ productions are delighting audiences on screens large and small. We're sharing powerful works of imagination with series and movies like Presumed Innocent, the Upcoming Disclaimer, and The Instigators starring Matt Damon. And we can't wait for returning fan favorites with new seasons of The Morning Show, Slow Horses, and Severance. Apple TV+ productions also continue to earn accolades with nearly 2,300 nominations and 500 wins to-date. That includes 72 Emmy Award nominations across 16 programs our best ever showing for the upcoming awards event. During the quarter, we also expanded Tap to Pay on iPhone to more markets including Japan, Canada, Italy, and Germany, enabling more businesses to use the power of iPhone to accept contactless payments. And we announced new updates to our services coming this fall, including US national park hikes and custom walk routes and Apple Maps, the ability to pay with rewards using Apple Pay, collaborative listening with Apple Music, and a redesigned Apple Fitness+ experience to help users make the most of our library of workouts and meditations. Turning to retail, we continue to expand in emerging markets with our first ever location in Malaysia. Customers from all over the country came together with our team members to celebrate this special moment. Elsewhere in the world, our teams have been sharing the magic of Apple Vision Pro and demos that delight, inspire, and deeply move customers exploring the wonders of spatial computing for the first time. At the heart of all of our innovations are the values that guide everything we do. We believe fundamentally that the best technology is technology that works for everyone. And in honor of Global Accessibility Awareness Day, we introduced all new capabilities to give users more ways to take advantage of all our products can do. These include eye tracking for users to control iPhone or iPad visually, music haptics to give those who are deaf or hard of hearing a tangible way to experience music, and vocal shortcuts that tie task to a user's voice. And we are committed as ever to shipping products that offer the highest standards of privacy for our users. With everything we do, whether it's offering a browser like Safari that prevents third-parties from tracking you across the internet or providing new features like the ability to lock and hide apps, we are determined to keep our users in control of their own data. And we are just as dedicated to ensuring the security of our users' data. That's why we work to minimize the amount of data we collect and work to maximize how much is processed directly on people's devices, a foundational principle that is at the core of all we build, including Apple Intelligence. And we continue to make significant progress on the environment. We are proud to say that all of our data centers, including those that will run private cloud compute, operate on 100% renewable energy. At Apple, we're constantly accelerating our pace of innovation. We are a company in relentless pursuit of big ideas. Time and again, we've seen how a spark of creativity can reach breakthrough velocity, reach across previously unexplored dimensions, and ultimately take flight in ways that can change the world. It's why we're going to keep investing in the meaningful innovation that enriches the lives of all of our customers. We have a busy time ahead of us, and I couldn't be more excited for all the amazing things yet to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.
Luca Maestri : Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to report a new June quarter revenue record of $85.8 billion, up 5% year-over-year, despite 230 basis points of negative foreign exchange impact. We achieved growth in the vast majority of our markets, with June quarter revenue records in the Americas, Europe, and rest of Asia Pacific. Products revenue was $61.6 billion, up 2% year-over-year, driven by the launch of the new iPad Pro and iPad Air. Our installed base of active devices reach an all-time high across all products and geographic segments, thanks to our unmatched levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty and a large number of customers who are new to our products. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $24.2 billion, up 14% year-over-year, with an all-time record in developed markets and a June quarter record in emerging markets. Company gross margin was 46.3% near the high end of our guidance range and down 30 basis points sequentially driven by a different mix within products which was partially offset by a favorable mix shift towards services and cost savings. Products gross margin was 35.3%, down 130 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by mix, partially offset by favorable costs. Services gross margin was 74% down 60 basis points from last quarter. Operating expenses of $14.3 billion were at the low end of the guidance range we provided and up 7% year-over-year. Net income was $21.4 billion, diluted EPS of $1.40 was up 11% year-over-year and set a June quarter record. And operating cash flow was very strong at $28.9 billion, also a June quarter record. Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $39.3 billion, down 1% year-over-year, but grew on a constant currency basis. We set June quarter records across several countries, including the UK, Spain, Poland, Mexico, Indonesia, and the Philippines. And the iPhone Active installed base grew to a new all-time high in total and in every geographic segment. During the June quarter, many iPhone models were among the top selling smartphones around the world. In fact, according to a survey from Kantar, iPhone was the top selling model in the US, urban China, the UK, Germany, Australia, and Japan. Customer satisfaction on the iPhone 15 family continues to be extremely high, with 451 Research measuring it at 98% in the US in their latest reports. Mac generated $7 billion in revenue, up 2% year-over-year, driven by the MacBook Air powered by the M3 chip. We saw particularly strong performance in our emerging markets, with June quarter records for Mac in Latin America, India, and South Asia. The Mac installed base reached an all-time high with half of MacBook Air customers in the quarter being new to Mac. And customer satisfaction for Mac was recently reported at 96% in the US. iPad revenue was $7.2 billion, up 24% year-over-year, driven by the launch of the new iPad Pro and iPad Air. Customers are loving the latest iPad lineup for its new design and display, unparalleled performance, AI capabilities and much more. The iPad install base has continued to grow and is an all-time high, as half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product. Also, customer satisfaction was recently measured at 97% in the US. Wearables, home and accessories revenue was $8.1 billion, down 2% year-over-year, a sequential acceleration from the March quarter. Watch and AirPods continue to face a difficult compare against prior year launches of the AirPods Pro second generation, the Watch SE and the first Watch Ultra. Apple Watch continues to attract new customers, with almost two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product, sending the Apple Watch install base to a new all-time high. And the latest reports from 451 Research indicate a customer satisfaction of 97% for watch in the US. In services, total revenue reached an all-time record of $24.2 billion, growing 14% year-over-year. We continue to have great momentum in services, as the growth of our installed base of active devices, sets a strong foundation for the future expansion of our ecosystem. And we see increased customer engagement with our services offerings. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts reach a new all-time high with paid accounts growing double digits year-over-year. Also, paid subscriptions showed strong double digit growth. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, more than double the number that we had only four years ago. And we are constantly focused on improving the breadth and quality of our services. From critically acclaimed new content on Apple TV+ to new games on Apple Arcade and the many latest features we previewed during WWDC for iCloud, Apple Pay, Apple Cash, Apple Music, and more. Turning to enterprise, we continue to see businesses, leveraging our entire suite of products to drive productivity and creativity for their teams and customers. USAA, a leading insurance and financial services company, recently expanded beyond their existing iPhone and iPad deployments to provide their employees with the latest MacBook Air. And American Express has continued to add to their fleet of over 10,000 Macs to enhance their employees' productivity, security, and collaboration. We're also excited to see leading organizations such as Boston Children's Hospital and Lufthansa using Apple Vision Pro to build innovative spatial computing experiences to transform the training of their workforces. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $153 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $4.3 billion in maturing debt and increased commercial paper by $1 billion, leaving us with total debt of $101 billion. As a result, net cash was $52 billion at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, we returned over $32 billion to shareholders, including $3.9 billion in dividends and equivalents and $26 billion through open market repurchases of 139 million Apple shares. As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we are providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. We expect foreign exchange to continue to be a headwind and to have a negative impact on revenue of about 1.5 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. We expect our September quarter total company revenue to grow year-over-year at a rate similar to the June quarter. We expect services revenue to grow double digits at a rate similar to what we reported in the first three quarters of this fiscal year. We expect gross margin to be between 45.5% and 46.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $14.2 billion and $14.4 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $50 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark to market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16.5%. Finally, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock payable on August 15, 2024, to shareholders of record as of August 12, 2024. With that, let's open the call to questions.
Suhasini Chandramouli : Thank you Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?
Operator: Certainly. We will go ahead and take our first question from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Erik Woodring: Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. Maybe Tim, if we start with you, you know, I thought some of the color you provided before the call about iPhone 15 performing better than the iPhone 14 was interesting. So just with that context, can you maybe help us understand where you see iPhone replacement cycles today, where you think the size of the base of iPhones that are aged and likely to upgrade are, and what that translates to in potential pent-up demand, as we enter a new iPhone cycle. And I have a follow-up, thank you.
Tim Cook: Yes, hi Eric. The installed base hit an all-time high during the quarter and so we were very happy about that. iPhone in general grew in constant currency. And the 15, as you point out, if you look at the same number of weeks of the 15 from launch and compare that to the 14, the 15 is doing better than the 14. And so that's kind of a state of where we currently are. In terms of upgrade rates, it's very difficult mid-cycle to call upgrade rates. I would just say that with Apple Intelligence, we are very excited about the level of value that we're going to provide to users. And we believe that -- that presents another reason for a compelling upgrade.
Erik Woodring: Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks, Tim. And then second, can you maybe dig into the China dynamics a bit? Sales down 6% this quarter, 3% in constant currency, an improvement from last quarter on a tougher compare that came on the back of some iPhone discounting. So can you maybe just share color on the China market as a whole how much you believe promotions helped in the quarter, how sustainable this improvement is, and if this performance really changes any of your approach to the China market as we look forward. Thanks so much.
Tim Cook: Yeah, Erik, as you point out, we decreased by 6.5% year-over-year for the whole of Greater China. And if you look at it on a constant currency basis, we declined by less than 3%. So over 50% of the decline year-over-year is currency related. That is an improvement from the first half of the fiscal year, and so we're happy to see the acceleration. If you look at iPhone in particular for Greater China, the installed base set a record. We also in Mainland China set a June quarter record for upgraders and so that's a very strong signal and in fact from Kantar -- the survey from Kantar this quarter showed that iPhones were the top three models in urban China. Also, if you look at -- one of the things we look at is the 15 family compared to the 14 family for the same number of weeks from launch. So this goes all the way back to the September of 2023. If you look at that, the 15 is outperforming the 14. And so those are some of the color I would provide. In addition, one of the things that we're very focused on is the level of new customers buying our products. And so if you look at this on the Mac and iPad, in Mainland China, the majority of customers buying or buying for the first time, buying that product for the first time and the watch, the vast, vast majority of people are buying a product for the first time. And during the quarter, I should say also that iPad returned to growth in Greater China, as it did around the world. And so we continue to be confident in the long-term opportunity in China. I don't know how every chapter of the book reads, but we're very confident in the long-term.
Erik Woodring: Great. Thanks so much.
Tim Cook: Yeah.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Erik. Operator, may we have the next question, please?
Operator: Our next question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius. Please go ahead.
Ben Reitzes: Hey, thanks a lot. Appreciate it. Hey, Tim, you know, now that you've launched or announced Apple intelligence, do you have any ideas on how it may impact services. Would it – do you feel like it'll accelerate your Services business augmented? And maybe folks will need to buy more storage and some other things. How are you thinking about it as a catalyst for Services into next year? And I have a follow-up. Thanks.
Tim Cook: We started the rollout of Apple Intelligence this week with developers, so some of the features are out there as of Monday. And we couldn't be more excited about getting them out there. Obviously, this will enable developers to take their apps to the next level. And so we are taking the first step in getting the beta out there, and we can't wait to see what kind of amazing things they do with it.
Ben Reitzes: Okay. Thanks. And then Luca, with regard to gross margin, it's been -- there's been some component price inflation and mix. Do you mind just giving us a little more color on how you are managing that sequentially and how you feel about the current component environment as an impact on margins? Thanks.
Luca Maestri: Sure, Ben. I think I'll give you a bit of the walk for the June quarter and then get into the outlook that we provided for the September quarter. At the total company level, we've reported 46.3%. It is down 30 basis points sequentially, and it was really driven by a different mix. Within products, of course, we launched very important products like the iPad during the course of the quarter. But we had an offset from a shift in mix towards Services, and we got some good cost savings. And so when you look at it on a year-over-year basis, we are up significantly on the margin front. And keep in mind that foreign exchange continues to be a bit of a headwind for us. As we go into the September quarter, we are guiding 45.5% to 46.5%, which is kind of within the guidance that we provided last quarter. Again similar dynamics, we expect a slightly different mix. We expect foreign exchange to have a minimal impact sequentially, although a more significant impact on a year-over-year basis. On the commodity side, I think that is what you are referring to, yes we have seen some increases on the memory front, but the rest of the commodities, we see a continuous decline. So in general, we feel -- we're well positioned. And as you know well, these are very high levels of gross margin for us and we are pleased where we are.
Ben Reitzes: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you Ben. Operator may we have the next question please.
Operator: Our next question is from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Mike Ng: Hi, good afternoon. I just have two questions. First, I was wondering if you could talk about whether or not you've seen a shift in demand for iPhone 15 Pro, Pro Max models since WWDC that could potentially foreshadow consumer demand for Apple Intelligence enabled phones?
Tim Cook: We just announced the sort of the requirements at the system and the silicon level in June. And so we had very limited time during the quarter. So it's really too early to tell.
Mike Ng: That's fair. And then with the focus on upgrader potential over the next several years, I was just wondering if you could talk about what you are expecting from the US promotional environment from your channel partners, whether that's US wireless carriers, given the importance of device sales for those partners during an upgrade cycle. Or any retail support on what could be a very strong smartphone upgrade period? Thank you.
Tim Cook: We are very excited about Apple Intelligence and what it brings, and it is another compelling reason for an upgrade. I'd leave the promotional question for the sort of the carriers themselves to answer. But I believe it will be a very key time for -- and a compelling upgrade cycle.
Mike Ng: Great. Thank you Tim.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thanks Mike. Operator, can we have the next question please.
Operator: Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Amit Daryanani: Good afternoon everyone. And I have two as well. I guess, Tim, maybe back to the Apple Intelligence dynamic. There's clearly a lot of excitement from consumers around what Apple Intelligence could mean for them. Can you just touch on your -- do you think the intent is to launch all the Apple Intelligence features at the same time to consumers, or do you think they end up getting staggered a bit? And if they are staggered, do you think it impacts how consumers come out and buy the next-generation iPhone?
Tim Cook: The rollout, as we mentioned in June, sort of -- we've actually started with developers this week. We started with some features of Apple Intelligence, not the complete suite. There are other features like languages beyond US English that will happen over the course of the year, and there are other features that will happen over the course of the year. And ChatGPT is integrated by the end of the calendar year. And so yes, so it’s a staggered launch.
Amit Daryanani: Got it. And then I guess your Services growth rates have been extremely impressive for several quarters and it seems like it is accelerated recently. Can you just touch -- talk about when you look at this double-digit growth, how much of that do you think is coming from the installed base growth versus better ARPU or better monetization of the installed base? And how do you kind of see that mix changing as you go forward?
Luca Maestri: Yes, Amit, it is Luca. It's a combination of a number of factors. The installed base growth is very important of course, because we have a larger pool of customers that uses the ecosystem and uses our Services. We are seeing and we've seen this consistently for many, many quarters now. We see continued growth in the level of engagement that our customers have with our ecosystem. We have more transacting accounts every quarter, so more people using the ecosystem both the free elements of the ecosystem and the paid elements. We see paid accounts growing double digits, and we've seen that for many, many quarters. Now we look at our paid subscriptions on our platform, and they are growing strong double digits as well. So obviously, the growing level of engagement helps us both from an ARPU standpoint and just a volume standpoint. Obviously, as you've seen over the last several years, we launched new services over time, and we've launched many new services, fairly recently. Obviously, our payments business is relatively new, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Fitness+, so many other services we've added. And so we are providing more and more opportunities for our customers to interact with the ecosystem. And we believe we are doing also a very good job at improving the quality of these services and improving the amount of content that we make available. We continue to make significant investments on TV+, on Apple Arcade. We are launching new shows, new games all the time. And I think you will continue to see that as we go forward. We are very, very happy with the 14% growth that we had this quarter because, particularly if you look at the performance that we had in Services a year ago, the compares for us tend to get a bit more challenging in the second half of our fiscal year. But in spite of that, we delivered a level of growth that was better than what we were expecting at the beginning of the quarter.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thanks Amit. Operator we will take the next question please.
Operator: Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Wamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you so much. Tim, you announced Apple Intelligence, but you also announced partnerships with OpenAI and presumably more coming down the road. How should investors think about the monetization models around these partnerships where the CapEx investments are clearly being made by these potential partners. But you're obviously -- they're leveraging your distribution to your very attractive installed base. So in the long-term, do you see the Apple Intelligence part -- the Services growth from Apple Intelligence being the larger contributor over time? Or do you see these partnerships becoming a larger contributor over time? And I have a follow-up.
Tim Cook: I think the way that I look at it is that Apple Intelligence is the on-device processing and the Private Cloud Compute. And a lot of that will be things with a personal context. And then for world knowledge, we are integrating with ChatGPT initially, and that will be focused on world knowledge as I said. And so the monetization model, I don't want to get into the terms of the commercial agreements because they are confidential between the parties. But I see both aspects as being very important. People want both.
Wamsi Mohan: Okay. Thanks. As a follow-up maybe for Luca. Just stepping back to the gross margin discussion again. If I look at calendar 2023, you had on average 150 basis points increase in product gross margins on a year-on-year basis. In 2024 so far, it had been more flat year-on-year. When we think about that, is the incremental headwind, I mean there was FX headwinds throughout the last several years. So ex-FX, are there other incremental headwinds that are either temporary or structural in nature that are perhaps limiting further upside to what are obviously very strong gross margins? Thank you.
Luca Maestri: Yes. Of course, as you said, the foreign exchange continues to be -- this is incremental on a year-over-year basis. And it is one of those things that is outside of our control. We try to hedge our exposures. But it is what it is. We know that when the dollar is strong, our gross margins are affected. The other element that I think it's always important to keep in mind is that within the Products business, our products have different margin profiles. And depending on the relative success in the marketplace, our products' gross margin tends to move. And so the mix of our products has an impact on gross margins, right? And so we need to pay attention to that. Of course, we just launched an iPad and that is one of the factors. But we want all our products to be very successful in the marketplace. And that's why we always look at gross margin dollars as the first order of priority, and gross margin percentage tends to follow from that. The other factor that obviously has an impact, a significant impact is the state of the commodity markets, and they tend to go in cycles. And so we will see how that plays out over time. But in general, we feel good about the level of gross margins that we have for our products business, and we think we are in a good position there.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thanks Wamsi. Operator, can we have the next question please.
Operator: Our next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Krish Sankar: Hi, thanks for taking my question. And congrats on the strong results. The first one for Luca or Tim. We keep hearing about these increasing silicon content for AI edge devices. And also, I think, Luca you spoke about increasing commodity costs. So I'm curious how to think about margins for these new AI devices. And Tim, do any of these Apple Intelligence features need more hardware updates than what we have today? And then I have a quick follow-up.
Tim Cook: Maybe I'll take the second one first and then pass it over to Luca. In terms of the requirements to run Apple Intelligence, there are system requirements and there are silicon requirements. And so from an iPhone point of view, the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max will run Apple Intelligence and the successor products obviously. If you look at the Mac, it starts with the M series of silicon that started in 2020. And the iPad is the same, and so it starts with the M series of silicon. And so there are system requirements and silicon requirements that go with each of those.
Luca Maestri: And from a gross margin standpoint, as you know, we don't provide any color past the current quarter, and we just provided guidance for the quarter 45.5% to 46.5%. It is essentially broadly in line with what we reported for the June quarter. So we'll take it quarter by quarter and we will report as the time goes by.
Krish Sankar: Got it. Very helpful. And then a quick follow-up for Tim. Thanks for the color on China. We also see many other consumer discretionary and luxury brands talk about a weak China. And I think Tim, you said half the details was FX related. I'm curious, the other half of the weakness, was that more China macro related or do you think it is kind of like specific to Apple with domestic competitors? Any other color you could give would be very helpful. Thank you very much.
Tim Cook: Well, certainly, the competitive environment there is the most competitive in the world. I've said that before and that remains to be the case. The macroeconomic factors have been in the press too, and I'm not an expert on those. I can only tell you what we're seeing. And we were pleased that the business showed improvement from the first half of the year.
Krish Sankar: Thanks Tim.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you Krish. Operator, can we have the next question please.
Operator: Our next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.
David Vogt: Great. Two, if I may also. Tim, first one for you. I know it is early days, and you talked about the developers just getting their hands on Apple Intelligence. But when you think about the categories that are currently in the App Store and kind of what you think app developers could do with this new technology, what's your instinct say in terms of -- are these going to be iterative applications to currently available applications? Is there any sort of category that you think lends itself more naturally to Apple Intelligence? Is it games? Is it more creative? I'm just trying to get a sense of how you're thinking about it. And then I have a follow-up for Luca. Thanks.
Tim Cook: If you look at how we've deployed Apple Intelligence or are deploying Apple Intelligence, we've really thought about it at pretty much all of the apps that you use every day. And so we've thought about it from Notes to Mail to Messages and all the rest. And so there is been a deep level of thinking about how it affects those apps. And that's going to surface Apple Intelligence in a way that is natural to the user, in a way that will I think, get them very excited about it and get usage. Similarly, I think the developers will do that on a broad basis with their apps as well. And so I think, it is profound and we'll see what the developers do. But we're very excited to get the initial seed out there this week and see what they do. I think it will be amazing, yes.
David Vogt: Yes. No, that's helpful. I appreciate it. And Luca, just maybe -- I know you didn't give a full rundown of product categories in your prepared remarks. But if I kind of take your comments at face value, I guess what I'm trying to think about is for the next quarter, it sounds like with Services being relatively strong and FX easing a little bit. You are effectively saying that product revenue in the September quarter is going to basically be flat with the September quarter last year ahead of a product launch. And so I'm just trying to get a sense for, what are the puts and takes in that sort of outlook particularly as you have Apple Intelligence hopefully stoking the fire for demand going forward? Thanks.
Luca Maestri: Well, we have provided -- let me repeat what we provided. We think that we are going to be growing total company revenue at a rate that is similar to what we reported, so the plus 5%, right? In spite of the fact that we are going to have some foreign exchange headwinds, and we said about 150 basis points in the December quarter. And we said that we will grow Services double digits at a rate that is similar to what we've reported for the first three quarters of the fiscal year. We are not going into the other categories. I think there is a lot of good math that you can do from what we've given you here. Keep in mind on the Mac that we will have a challenging compare from a year ago, given the fact that we launched and we had the full quarter impact of the launch of the MacBook Air 15-inch a year ago. And also on the iPad, we reported 24% growth in the June quarter. Clearly we had the benefit from the launch in the June quarter of the new products, the iPad Air and the iPad Pro. So important to keep that in mind on a sequential basis.
David Vogt: Great. Thank you very much.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you David. Operator may we have the next question please.
Operator: Our next question is from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead.
Atif Malik: Hi, thank you for taking my question. The first one is for Tim. I know it's early days. The feedback on Apple Intelligence software features like notification summary and reduced interruption focus from the developers who have tried the iOS 18.1 beta version this week is very positive. My question is in response to an earlier question, you talked about a staggered launch on some of these software features. So are you expecting most of the features that you announced at WWDC to be part of iOS 18? Or we should be thinking that some of these features could potentially be part of iOS 19 next year?
Tim Cook: Our objective that we said in June is to roll out US English starting in the fall and that is to users, and then proceed with more functionality, more features, if you will, and more languages and regions coverage as we proceed across the next year. And so we sort of gave a time frame that -- and we're tracking to that.
Atif Malik: Understand. And the next one for Luca. Luca the Services growth momentum seems very strong. Are you seeing any impact from changes made to comply with the DMA rules?
Luca Maestri: Well, as you know we have introduced some changes to the way we run the App Store in Europe already in March. And we are seeing a good level of adoption from developers on those changes. We are on an ongoing basis, discussing with the European Commission how to ensure full compliance with the DMA. It is obviously early stage, but in general, our results for the Services business and for the App Store have been pretty good until now. Again to just provide you a frame of reference, the percentage of revenue that we generate from the European Union on the App Store is about 7% of the total.
Atif Malik: Very helpful. Thank you.
Suhasini Chandramouli : Thank you Atif. Operator may we have the next question please.
Operator: Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Samik Chatterjee: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, Tim, if I can just ask you about Apple Intelligence as well. There is a regulatory aspect as well in certain geographies. You mentioned the staggered launch that you are aiming for and the timelines you're thinking. How are you thinking about the complexity of the regulatory process, in particular like EU and maybe China? And does -- in terms of your timelines of the rollout, are you sort of embedding in the regulatory aspect here? And how should we think about timing then including that? And I have a follow-up. Thank you.
Tim Cook: We are engaged as you would guess, with both regulatory bodies that you mentioned. And our objective is to move as fast as we can, obviously because our objective is always to get features out there for everyone. We have to understand the regulatory requirements before we can commit to doing that and commit a schedule to doing that. But we're very constructively engaged with both.
Samik Chatterjee: Okay, got it. And a quick one on the Wearables category, Luca. I know you mentioned the acceleration there on a sequential basis. Maybe you can just sort of parse that out in terms of what -- which categories drove the acceleration because that's been a category that has been lagging a bit in terms of revenue trends for the past couple of quarters. So just curious what is starting to sort of drive it to accelerate on a sequential basis? Thank you.
Tim Cook: Yes, I'll take that one. I think the important thing to remember when you look at the Wearables, Home and Accessories categories is that we have a difficult launch compare. And we've been running that for a few quarters and we still have that because last year had the continued benefit from the AirPods Pro second generation, the Watch SE and the very first Watch Ultra. And so it is important to keep that in mind. If you sort of take a step back, however and look at the business across the trailing 12 months, it is grown -- the Wearables, Home and Accessories business has grown to almost $40 billion, which is double what it was five years ago.
Samik Chatterjee: Thank you.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you Samik. Operator, may we have the last question please.
Operator: Our last question is from Richard Kramer with Arete Research. Please go ahead.
Richard Kramer: Thanks. Thanks very much. Tim, you referenced the investment in innovation, and your R&D sales ratio reached what I think was a June quarter record even before launching Apple Intelligence. Do you see the rollout of these features requiring further increases in R&D or increases in OpEx or CapEx for cloud compute capacity? And is it even possible to forecast the Services usage as they roll out, given that they are so new for consumers? Thanks.
Tim Cook: Clearly, we have increased R&D over time. We have been investing in AI and ML for years. And in addition to investing more, we've also redeployed certain skills onto AI and ML. And so the growth in sort of embedded in our numbers that we've shared here, it is increasing year-over-year. On the CapEx part, it is important to remember that we employ a hybrid kind of approach, where we do things internally and we have certain partners that we do business with externally where the CapEx would appear in their respective businesses. But yes, I mean you can expect that there is -- we will continue to invest and increase it year-on-year.
Richard Kramer: Okay. And maybe a quick follow-up for Luca. When we look at the free cash flow margins for the first nine months, they are up materially. And given this year's product mix, can you describe to us what exactly in the Services mix or cost control is driving what seems to be structurally higher free cash flow margins across the business?
Luca Maestri: Yes, I'm glad you noticed that. We are pretty pleased with that fact. And I think you probably also noticed that we've increased our return of capital to shareholders this quarter. This one was a record quarter for us. Well, it's a combination of a number of things. Of course, an improvement in the top-line helps the margin expansion that we've had over the last several years and several quarters obviously has helped. And so that is driving better operating cash flow. On the CapEx front as Tim said, we employ a hybrid model. Some of the investments show up on our balance sheet and some other investments show up somewhere else and we pay, as we go. But in general, we try to run the company efficiently. We continue to think that capital efficiency is a good thing. And therefore, we are pleased with the fact that our free cash flow is doing well this year.
Richard Kramer: Okay. Thanks.

AAPL,2024,4,2024-Q4-AAPL,"Suhasini Chandramouli: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Apple Q4 Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Suhasini Chandramouli, Director of Investor Relations. Today's call is being recorded. Speaking first today are Apple CEO, Tim Cook, and CFO, Luca Maestri, and they'll be joined by Kevan Parekh, Vice President of Financial Planning and Analysis. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook, including the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions on the company's business and results of operations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast.

Additionally, today's discussion will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these measures in our fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings release, which is available on our Investor Relations website. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.
Tim Cook: Thank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $94.9 billion, a September quarter record and up 6% from a year ago. iPhone grew in every geographic segment, marking a new September quarter revenue record for the category, and Services set an all-time revenue record, up 12% year-over-year. We also set September quarter segment revenue records in the Americas, Europe, and the Rest of Asia Pacific, as well as in a large number of countries, including the United States, Brazil, Mexico, France, the UK, Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. And we continue to be excited by the enthusiasm we're seeing in India, where we set an all-time revenue record. This has been an extraordinary year of innovation at Apple. We brought the revolutionary Apple Vision Pro to customers in February, which brings users tomorrow's technology today. And in June, we announced Apple Intelligence, a remarkable personal intelligence system that combines the power of generative models with personal context to deliver intelligence that is incredibly useful and relevant. Apple Intelligence marks the beginning of a new chapter for Apple innovation and redefines privacy and AI by extending our groundbreaking approach to privacy into the cloud with Private Cloud Compute. Earlier this week, we made the first set of Apple Intelligence features available in US English for iPhone, iPad, and Mac users, with systemwide Writing Tools that help you refine your writing, a more natural and conversational Siri, a more intelligent Photos app, including the ability to create movies simply by typing a description, and new ways to prioritize and stay in the moment with notification summaries and priority messages. And we look forward to additional intelligence features in December, with even more powerful Writing Tools, a new visual intelligence experience that builds on Apple Intelligence, and ChatGPT integration, as well as localized English in several countries, including the UK, Australia, and Canada. These features have already been provided to developers and we're getting great feedback. More features will be rolling out in the coming months, as well as support for more languages, and this is just the beginning. Now, I'll turn to our results for the quarter, beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenues set a September quarter record of $46.2 billion, up 6% from a year ago, with growth in every geographic segment. With the introduction of Apple Intelligence, we're beginning a new era for iPhone. iPhone 16, powered by A18, is equipped with an incredible new 48-megapixel Fusion camera, fantastic photo experiences, and the addition of the action button and camera control. An iPhone 16 Pro is the most advanced iPhone we've ever made, powered by A18 Pro and featuring even larger displays, an industry-leading pro camera system with camera control, and studio quality mics, all with a huge leap in battery life. Turning to Mac, revenue was $7.7 billion, up 2% from a year ago. Just this week, we brought a new generation of Apple Silicon to Mac, M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max. From blazing fast performance to Apple's most advanced neural engine yet, our latest chips can easily tackle incredibly complex workflows, and they ensure our newest Macs will be the best personal computers for AI the instant they hit stores. With the newest additions to our Mac lineup, customers can choose the Mac that's just right for them, whether that's iMac, the world's best and most beautiful all-in-one; MacBook Air, the world's most popular laptop now with double the starting memory; MacBook Pro, the best Pro notebook anywhere; or the incredible, mighty new Mac mini, our first-ever carbon-neutral Mac. iPad revenue was $7 billion, 8% higher year-over-year. iPad is unlike any other product on the market today, and it's become an essential device in homes, schools, and businesses of all sizes. Recently, we were thrilled to introduce the newest iPad mini, featuring an ultra-compact design built for Apple Intelligence with support for Apple Pencil Pro. It's been a big year for iPad. iPad Air was popular with students and teachers as they got back to school this year, while creators are pushing the boundaries of what's possible with the M4-powered iPad Pro. In Wearables, Home and Accessories, revenue was $9 billion, down 3% from a year ago. During the quarter, we launched the all-new Apple Watch Series 10, bringing a beautiful new design and new capabilities to the world's most popular watch that make it even more powerful, intelligent, and sophisticated. It's the thinnest Apple Watch yet, making it more comfortable than ever, while offering the biggest, most advanced display. watchOS 11 brings some huge new health and fitness insights to users, including sleep apnea notifications, which help to alert people with a potentially serious but often undiagnosed condition. We're proud of the impact we make through our health innovations on watch, and I'm grateful for every note I receive about the importance of watch in people's lives. With AirPods 4, we broke a new ground in comfort and design with our best-ever open-ear headphones available for the first time with active noise cancellation. And we were especially pleased to unveil revolutionary end-to-end hearing health capabilities for AirPods Pro 2 with hearing protection, hearing test, and hearing aid features. These just became available in a software update this week, and we believe this will make a meaningful difference in our users' lives. I've already started getting notes from customers calling the experience life changing. And Apple Vision Pro continues to deliver spatial experiences that weren't possible before, including immersive entertainment like the new short film, Submerged, which gives people a view into the unique storytelling power made possible by spatial computing. Vision Pro has more than 2,500 native spatial apps and 1.5 million compatible apps for visionOS 2, as well as applications companies are building to reimagine how they work. Vision Pro continues to inspire awe in its users, and we're just scratching the surface of what's possible. And just yesterday, we announced we're bringing Vision Pro to Korea and the UAE. As I mentioned earlier, Services achieved an all-time revenue record of $25 billion, up 12% from a year ago, and with all-time revenue records across most of our categories. With Apple TV+, we love celebrating the craft of great storytellers who know how to put on a show. Audiences love to discover new movies like Wolfs, explore acclaimed new series like Disclaimer, and dive back into returning favorites like Slow Horses and Shrinking. Apple TV+ productions have become fixtures at award shows, earning more than 2,300 nominations and more than 500 wins today. Apple also offers a live sports experience in a league of its own with MLS Season Pass, and subscribers have been cheering on their favorite teams in the MLS Cup playoffs. This month, we also marked 10 years of Apple Pay. There's always something magical about being able to buy groceries or pay for movie tickets seamlessly with your Apple device. Today, users choose Apple Pay for purchases across tens of millions of retailers worldwide. And we're excited to make the Apple Pay experience even better, with the option to redeem rewards and access loans from credit cards, debit cards, and other lenders right at checkout. Whenever we celebrate big moments, Apple Stores are the best places to share them with customers. I had an incredible time during launch day in September alongside our team at Apple Fifth Avenue, where energy and enthusiasm filled the air. And in stores all over the world, customers are eager to get a closer look at our latest innovations. We also opened two new stores during the quarter and we can't wait to bring four new stores to customers in India. We're passionate about education and believe technology has a vital role to play in both helping teachers to inspire their students and students to learn about the world around them. In honor of World Teachers' Day, Apple was proud to share new resources for teachers to engage their students in ways that aim to make learning easy and fun. Additionally, we've expanded our education grant program into 100 new schools and communities, helping with everything from access to technology, to educator resources, to scholarships and financial support. As we near the end of the year, we're proud of the progress we've made in our efforts to be carbon-neutral across our entire footprint by the end of the decade. As I mentioned earlier, we were thrilled to introduce our first-ever carbon-neutral Mac with the latest Mac mini. And in another milestone, customers can choose a carbon-neutral option of any Apple Watch. These achievements are amazing for all of us at Apple, and we are determined to reach our 2030 goal. At Apple, across everything we do, we manage for the long term, because we're always thinking about what comes next, the next great challenge, the next innovative idea, the next big breakthrough. As we close out the year, we have the best lineup we've ever had going into the holiday season, including Apple Intelligence, which marks the start of a new chapter for our products. This is just the beginning of what we believe generative AI can do, and I couldn't be more excited for what's to come. Before I hand it over to Luca, with Luca transitioning to a new role with Apple, this will be the final time he's joining our call. So, I just wanted to take a moment to recognize his extraordinary service as Apple's CFO and to thank him for his partnership. I am deeply grateful. In his 10 years in the role, Luca has done truly exceptional work in shaping Apple as we know it today. He has helped manage Apple for the long term, thoughtfully and deliberately. He has helped us enrich the lives of so many around the world, and he has been a leader that people look up to and have learned so much from. I have incredible confidence in our incoming CFO, Kevan Parekh, and we look forward to more of you meeting and working with him going forward. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.
Luca Maestri: Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you, Tim, for the very kind words. Serving as Apple's CFO has been a real privilege and an amazing journey, and I've greatly appreciated the support from our investors and the analyst community over the years. Kevan is exceptional, and I know you will enjoy interacting with him going forward. Let me now turn to the results for the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. We're very pleased to report a new September quarter revenue record of $94.9 billion, up 6% year-over-year. We grew in the vast majority of the markets we track and achieved September quarter revenue records in the Americas, Europe and Rest of Asia Pacific. Products revenue was $70 billion, up 4% year-over-year, driven by growth in iPhone, iPad and Mac. Our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and geographic segments, thanks to very high levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty and a large number of customers who are new to our products. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $25 billion, up 12% year-over-year. We saw broad-based strength around the world, reaching all-time records in both developed and emerging markets with double-digit growth and record results across most services categories. Company gross margin was 46.2%, near the high end of our guidance range. Products gross margin was 36.3%, up 100 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by favorable mix. Services gross margin was 74%, unchanged from the prior quarter. Operating expenses of $14.3 billion were at the midpoint of the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the quarter and up 6% year-over-year. During the quarter, we recorded a one-time income tax charge of $10.2 billion, which relates to the impact of the reversal of the European General Court's State Aid decision. When we exclude this one-time charge, net income was $25 billion and diluted earnings per share were a $1.64, up 12% year-over-year, and a September quarter record. Operating cash flow was very strong at $26.8 billion, a new September quarter record. Let me now get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $46.2 billion, up 6% year-over-year, and a September quarter record in total and across several markets, including the US, the Middle East, Korea, and South Asia. The iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high in total and in every geographic segment. During the September quarter, many iPhone models were among the top-selling smartphones around the world. In fact, according to a survey from Kantar, iPhone was the top-selling model in the US, Urban China, the UK, Australia, and Japan. We continue to see high levels of customer satisfaction for the iPhone 15 family, with 451 Research recently measuring it at 98% in the US. Mac revenue was $7.7 billion, up 2% year-over-year, driven by the strength in MacBook Air. Customers have been loving the performance of Apple Silicon on Mac and we are very excited to bring the latest M4 family of chips to the lineup. The Mac installed base reached an all-time high with about half of customers in the quarter being new to Mac. And in the latest reports from 451 Research, customer satisfaction was 95% in the US. iPad generated $7 billion in revenue, up 8% year-over-year. In addition to growth in developed markets, we also saw strong performance in many emerging markets, with double-digit growth in Mexico, Brazil, the Middle East, India and South Asia. The iPad installed base reached another all-time high, and over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product. Also, customer satisfaction was recently measured at 97% in the US. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $9 billion, down 3% year-over-year. The Apple Watch installed base reached a new all-time high, with over half of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. And the latest reports from 451 Research indicated customer satisfaction of 96% for watch in the US. Our Services revenue reached an all-time record of $25 billion, growing 12% year-over-year. Services continue to see strong momentum with the growth of our installed base of active devices setting a solid foundation for the future expansion of our ecosystem. And we see increased customer engagement with our services offerings. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts reached a new all-time high, with paid accounts growing double-digits year-over-year. Paid subscriptions also grew double-digits. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, more than double the number we had only four years ago. And as always, we remain focused on improving the breadth and quality of our services from new games on Apple Arcade to new features like Tap to Cash and pay with installments using Apple Pay to many successful new and returning shows on Apple TV+. This past quarter, we celebrated the five-year anniversary of Apple Card, which was ranked #1 in customer satisfaction among co-branded credit cards by J.D. Power for the fourth year in a row. Turning to enterprise, we continue to see strong demand across our products and services. NVIDIA launched its Mac as a choice program supported by AppleCare for Enterprise and Apple Professional Services with over 10,000 Macs deployed worldwide. And Novartis, a leading global pharmaceutical company, recently chose iPhone 16 as the standard mobile device for all employees. We also see continued momentum with Apple Vision Pro in the enterprise space. UC San Diego Health is the first hospital in the world to test spatial computing apps on Apple Vision Pro in clinical trials for patient surgery in the operating room. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $157 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $2.6 billion in maturing debt and increased commercial paper by $7 billion, leaving us with total debt of $107 billion. As a result, net cash was $50 billion at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, we returned over $29 billion to shareholders, including $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $25 billion through open market repurchases of 112 million Apple shares. As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we're providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. We expect our December quarter total company revenue to grow low- to mid-single digits year-over-year. We expect Services revenue to grow double-digits at a rate similar to what we reported in the fiscal year 2024. We expect gross margin to be between 46% and 47%. We expect OpEx to be between $15.3 billion and $15.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $250 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark to market of minority investments. And our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock payable on November 14, 2024 to shareholders of record as of November 11, 2024. With that, let us open the call to questions.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?
Operator: Certainly. We will go ahead and take our first question from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Michael Ng: Hey, good afternoon. I just have two. The first one is for Tim on Apple Intelligence. I was wondering if you could just expand a little bit on some of the early feedback to Apple Intelligence both for iOS 18.1, but also the developer beta so far, and whether you would attribute Apple Intelligence to any of the strong iPhone performance that we've seen to date. Thanks.
Tim Cook: Thanks, Michael. As I noted in my comments, just this week on Monday, we made the first set of Apple Intelligence features available in US English for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. This includes things like systemwide Writing Tools that help you refine your writing, a more natural conversational Siri, more intelligent Photos app, including the ability to create movies, simply by typing a description, which is really cool, and new ways to prioritize and stay in the moment with notification summaries and priority messages. There's also email summaries and email priority. We're getting a lot of positive feedback from developers and customers. And in fact, if you just look at the first three days, which is all we have obviously from Monday, the 18.1 adoption is twice as fast as the 17.1 adoption was in the year-ago quarter. And so, there's definitely interest out there for Apple Intelligence. Carrying on in the quarter, we are looking forward to bringing even more features in December, and this will include even more powerful Writing Tools and visual intelligence experience that builds on Apple Intelligence, and ChatGPT integration in addition to other features, as well as we'll bring localized English to several countries that include the UK, Australia, and Canada. So, it's going to be quite a software quarter between the release on Monday and the release in December. And then, as we turn the corner to '25, we'll have more languages rolling out, starting in April as well and more features as well. And so, it's a very strong drumbeat, and we couldn't be more excited about it.
Michael Ng: Great. Thank you very much. And my second one just for Luca. First, congratulations again, Luca, on the new role and it's been a real privilege being able to spend some time with you. A question that I think will overlap with your new role as well. Could you just talk a little bit about the CapEx outlook and whether investments in things like Private Cloud Compute could change the historical CapEx range of roughly $10 billion a year? Thank you very much.
Luca Maestri: Thank you, Michael. On the CapEx front, I've mentioned before a number of times, we have a bit of a hybrid model in the way we run our data centers. In some cases, we use our own data centers. In some cases, we use, third-party providers. So, our CapEx numbers may not be fully comparable with others. But, obviously, we are rolling out these features, Apple Intelligence features already now, and so we are making all the capacity that is needed available for these features. You will see in our 10-K the amount of CapEx that we've incurred during the course of fiscal '24, and we will -- in fiscal '25, we will continue to make all the investments that are necessary, and of course, the investments in AI-related CapEx will be made.
Michael Ng: Great. Thank you, Tim. Thank you, Luca.
Suhasini Chandramouli: All right. Thanks, Mike. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator: Our next question is from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Erik Woodring: Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions. I have two as well. Tim, maybe if we start with you, I think each of the last four years you've exited the December quarter with iPhone demand outpacing supply. As we look to this quarter in the iPhone 16 cycle, lead times are relatively short. There are no known supply shortages. And I'm just curious whether you've been able to maybe get a better read on early cycle iPhone demand this year relative to past years. And if so, what you've learned about upgrade rates, switching rates, trade-ups versus trading down and being more price sensitive? And overall, any impact that Apple Intelligence may have on iPhone 16 sales? And then, I have a follow-up. Thank you.
Tim Cook: There's a lot there. On Apple Intelligence, we believe it's a compelling upgrade reason. And we'll -- but we just launched it three days ago and so what we've got now from a data point point of view is the number I just referenced that 18.1 has twice the adoption rate of 17.1. So, that clearly shows a level of interest out there. In terms of exiting the December quarter with demand greater than supply, that's not my recollection that, that happened for all four of the years. We clearly had cases during COVID where there were disruptions and that's the some spilled over, but in a more regular environment where we're not having something, a 100-year flood kind of thing, we would -- our desire is to get into balance as quickly as possible. We don't want customers having to wait for products. And so, if you look at how we've done this year, we did that very quickly on the 16, on the 16 Pro family, the Pro and the Pro Max, we've been constrained in October, but we believe that soon we'll be out of constraint. And so, that's a good sign from our point of view. Keep in mind that, that's a function of supply and demand, not one side or the other. And we've been preparing for the quarter for a while. So that's what I would say there.
Erik Woodring: Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you, Tim.
Tim Cook: Yeah, thank you.
Erik Woodring: And then, Luca, if I just turn to you, obviously, it's been a pleasure working with you, and we wish you all the best in the next role. There's plenty of debate in the market right now about input costs and commodity prices, and the impact that will have on gross margins. Historically, you do guide gross margins up 50 basis points sequentially, which you just told us about for the December quarter. So, can you maybe just help us understand your view of component prices and broadly whether you still see those as tailwinds to gross margins and how sustainable that tailwind might be, or whether that should become a headwind as we look forward? Thanks so much.
Luca Maestri: Yes, Erik. As you know, our gross margins are a factor of many, many variables. Commodities, of course, are important. They're not the only factor. But specifically on commodities, I can tell you that both for the September quarter and what we expect for the December quarter, most commodities are going to move down in price, while NAND and DRAM increased during the course of the September quarter and we expect them to increase during the December quarter. We are very pleased with the level of gross margins that we've reported during the course of the year. The entire fiscal year of '24, they're really, for our company, record levels of gross margin, and obviously guiding to 46% to 47% for the December quarter with all the new technologies that we've included in the products, with all the new features that Tim has talked about, a lot of new products across the board, I think it's a very good sign.
Erik Woodring: Great. Thanks so much, Luca.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Erik. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator: Our next question is from Ben Reitzes from Melius. Please go ahead.
Ben Reitzes: Hey, thanks a lot. And I'll echo those comments about Luca. Miss you, and good luck. And my question is with regard to iPhone again, and with regard to the fourth quarter, is my first question -- or sorry, the fourth calendar quarter, your first quarter. When you look at mid- to low-single-digit revenue growth, do you expect the iPhone to grow faster? And what are you thinking about in the answer to that question with regard to China, which keeps improving each quarter? Thanks very much. And then, I have just a follow-up. Thanks.
Luca Maestri: Ben, we are not providing that level of color today. Yes, we've said that we expect total company revenue to grow low- to mid-single digits. Keep in mind, Apple Intelligence, as Tim said, is rolling out over time, both features and languages. And we just had a number of exciting launches just this week from the Apple Intelligence feature to the new Mac. So, we leave it at that. We've given you the total for the company and some pretty good direction on Services, which we expect to continue to grow at a similar rate than what we've seen in fiscal '24.
Ben Reitzes: Great. Thanks, Luca. Hey, Tim, I wanted to ask you, I mean, you guys are well aware a lot of the noise out there, people chattering about builds, lead times, and you guys are guiding for mid- to low-single-digit growth. That certainly doesn't sound like alarm bells here, vis-a-vis what you guys must be hearing. And I know you guys are just running your business and doing the best you can, but you have a lot of perspective now, Tim. What are people missing here? And it certainly just sounds like -- you guys are typically conservative. That guide for revenue is certainly sounds like [this guy is certainly not falling] (ph), and you have a pretty good product cycle. So, what do you think people are missing and what are you excited about? Thanks so much, Tim.
Tim Cook: Ben, I could not be more excited about Apple Intelligence and the rollout that we've got in front of us. I'm on the -- I'm obviously on future releases as well, working on it and it's changing my daily life. I'm super excited about the health features that we're rolling out. If the number of emails I'm already getting from customers that have taken a hearing test and are using their AirPods Pro 2 as a hearing aid, are just -- are staggering and heartwarming to read. I'm also thrilled about sleep apnea and the notification there that we'll have through the watch. This week is a very exciting week for us because we just rolled out three days -- three launches of different, Macs and desktops and laptops. And so, we have a lot of things on the docket and it's definitely the strongest lineup we've ever had going into the holiday season. In terms of the noise, I tune it out, because if not, it would just be, deafening. And so that that's what I do, I can't speak for everybody else, but that's what I do.
Ben Reitzes: Thanks a lot, Tim. Appreciate it.
Tim Cook: Thanks, Ben.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Ben. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator: Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Amit Daryanani: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two as well. And Luca, best of luck in the future. It's been a pleasure working with you. I guess the first one I have is, away from iPhones, on the Services side, you're adding $100 billion run rate with Services today, which is a phenomenal achievement by itself. As you look at the Services portfolio today, can you just talk about how much of this business do you think is reoccurring versus transactional? And are the growth rates different between the subscription portfolio over here versus transactional portfolio?
Luca Maestri: Yes, Amit, I'll take this one. Yes, we are, first of all, very, very happy with -- it's an important milestone. Of course, we've got to a run rate of $100 billion. You look back just a few years ago, and the growth has been phenomenal. We're very pleased. We've got a very diversified portfolio of services. And over the years, the amount that is recurring in nature has grown and is growing faster than the transactional piece. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions on our platform right now between our own services and third-party services. That continues to grow strong double-digits. So, we feel very, very good. And, essentially, to your question, yes, the recurring portion is growing faster than the transactional one.
Amit Daryanani: Got it. If I can just follow-up, if I look at the growth rates across the different geographies, there's always concern around China when it comes to iPhone demand, I feel, but the performance in September looks fairly good. I wonder if you just touch on, what are you seeing from a demand perspective in China? If the recent stimulus plan in China could essentially be a catalyst for iPhone? And then, EMEA really stood out with double-digit growth. Maybe you can just flush that out as well for us. Thank you.
Tim Cook: Yeah, I'll take the China question. If you look at how we did for the quarter, we were relatively flat year-over-year. And a key component of that improvement relative to the year-over-year performance that we had been achieving is that there was a sequential improvement in foreign exchange. And so that helped us out. As you know, it's been a headwind that we've been reporting for a period of time. And -- but the other parts that are -- what else is going on there is that our installed base of the active devices reached an all-time high. We had the top two selling, smartphones in Urban China according to Kantar. The level of new customers that we have buying the products like Mac and iPad are well over 50%. Watch is over three quarters that are new to the product. And so, there's several positive signs there. In terms of the stimulus, it's a clear focus of the team there, but I'm not an economist and don't want to ad lib on the effect of it.
Luca Maestri: On the Europe side, Amit, a number of things. As you see from our results during the quarter, Europe grew double-digits, 11%, and really, it was really good growth across the board, the different segments. They all did well. Keep in mind, our definition of Europe in our segment reporting includes a number of emerging markets, like Turkey, where we've grown very strongly, the Middle East. Tim mentioned a number of records in Saudi, in UAE, and we also include India where we set an all-time revenue record during the September quarter. But I have to say also Western Europe grew nicely. So, we've seen very good results for us in the entire segment.
Amit Daryanani: Great. Thank you very much.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Amit. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator: Our next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.
David Vogt: Great. Thanks everyone for taking my question, and congratulations, Luca. I know Luca, and I know Tim, you don't want to give a lot of granularity, but if I just try to pull together your comments about what the demand environment looks like, are we to assume based on sort of the commentary that there is a risk that maybe the product revenue portfolio could be down in the December quarter if I take your numbers at face value? And if that's the risk, is that more iPhone-related, Mac-related, given the strength that you've seen in iPad related? Just trying to get a handle on kind of what potentially is giving you that degree of, I don't want to say caution, but maybe balanced for you going into the December quarter. And then, I have a follow-up.
Luca Maestri: As I said, David, we're not providing that level of color. We're giving you some data on services. I would repeat what I said earlier. We're very early in the cycle, very early in the cycle with a lot of new products and features that that we are launching. And we're very excited about them, but it's early. And the Apple Intelligence rollout is going to happen over time, not across the world as normally we do with software releases.
David Vogt: Right. Okay. So maybe a follow-up for, Tim. When you think about to Luca's point about the rollout being staged over the next several quarters across the world, do you think that has any impact on sort of the normal historical demand cadence across different regions? So, should we see something different, let's say, in the December quarter, the March quarter, the June quarter, et cetera, relative to history, given the timing of the rollout and where customers are probably waiting for the devices to be enabled to have the operating system? Would just love to kind of get your perspective on how we think about the demand cadence, how it might be different than maybe historically? Thank you.
Tim Cook: Yeah, David. It's clearly, as you point out, a different cadence, if you will, than we would normally do. As we talked about at WWDC, we wanted to give a comprehensive vision of Apple Intelligence, and we said then that it would rollout over time. And we're right on the, what we said, at WWDC, and so we're executing well. In terms of the demand curve, I would just say that what we believe here is that it's a compelling reason for upgrading. And, it's -- that's both my personal experience and feedback that I'm getting and so we'll see. We're not projecting, beyond the current quarter obviously. We just don't do that.
David Vogt: Great. Thanks, Tim, and best of luck, Luca.
Luca Maestri: Thank you very much.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, David. We'll take the next question, please.
Operator: Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Wamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you so much. Luca, we will miss you on these calls. Tim, maybe for you, as you think about this staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence, can you help us think through potentially how much of the global installed base of phones will have access to Apple Intelligence in their native language, in their region within the next year or maybe in the next two years? And what are some of the gating factors in the rollout? And I have a follow-up.
Tim Cook: If you look at our schedule, we started in the -- with US English, that started on Monday. There's another release coming that adds additional features that I had referenced in December in not only US English but also localized for UK, Australia, Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand. And then, we will add more languages in April. We haven't set the specifics yet in terms of the languages, but we'll add more in April and then more as we step through the year. And so, we're moving just as fast as possible while ensuring quality. That's what we're doing.
Wamsi Mohan: Okay. Thanks, Tim.
Tim Cook: Yeah.
Wamsi Mohan: And then, as a follow-up, maybe this is a little premature, but how is Apple at a high level prepared to potentially deal with any tariffs that might come post the selection cycle? And if not exactly how, perhaps you can just help investors think about some of the things Apple has done already to try to insulate from some of these impacts, potential impacts?
Tim Cook: I wouldn't want to speculate about those sorts of things. And so, I'm going to punt on that one.
Wamsi Mohan: Okay. Thank you, Tim.
Tim Cook: Yeah. Thank you.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Wamsi. May we have the next question, please?
Operator: Our next question is from Krish Sankar from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Krish Sankar: Yeah. Hi, thanks for taking my question. And again, thanks Luca for all your help with analyts and investors. My first question is on R&D. Given how much your tech peers are spending on AI, does this new era of Apple Intelligence actually require Apple to invest more in R&D beyond your current 7% to 8% of sales to capture this opportunity? And then, I had a follow-up.
Luca Maestri: Krish, as you know, we've been investing heavily in R&D over the last several years. Our R&D growth has been significant during the last several years. And obviously, as we move through the course of fiscal '24, we've also reallocated some of the existing resources to this new technology to AI. And so, the level of intensity that we're putting into AI has increased a lot, and you maybe don't see the full extent of it because we've also had some internal reallocation of the base of engineering resources that we have within the company.
Krish Sankar: Got it. Thanks for that, Luca. And then, another quick follow-up. I understand Apple Intelligence is a feature on the phone today, but do you think that, in the future, it could potentially have or benefit the services growth business, or is that too -- are these too bifurcated to even make a call on the [indiscernible]? Thank you.
Tim Cook: I think, just to keep it in mind, Apple Intelligence is also available on the Mac for the M-series products and on certain models of iPad, and in addition to the phone. And so, it's on all three. You're quite -- what was your follow-on question?
Krish Sankar: Tim, it does on -- can the Apple Intelligence actually help the Services growth rate?
Tim Cook: Keep in mind that we were have released a lot of APIs and developers will be taking advantage of those APIs. That release has occurred as well and of course more are coming. And so I, definitely believe that a lot of developers will be taking advantage of Apple Intelligence in a big way. And what that does to Services, I'll not forecast, but I would say that from an ecosystem point of view, I think it will be great for the user and the user experience.
Krish Sankar: Got it. Thanks, Tim.
Tim Cook: Yeah.
Suhasini Chandramouli: All right. Thank you, Krish. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator: Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Samik Chatterjee: Great. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions. And Luca, congrats on the new role and pleasure working with you these years. I guess, if I could, for my first one, start with mix on the iPhone side? And what I'm really curious about if you have any thoughts given that Apple Intelligence is now going to be a consistent feature set across all the four sort of iPhones on the iPhone 16 series that you launched and going back to iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max. Are you seeing any change in behavior from a consumer perspective in terms of which sort of on the mix front within the iPhone series where consumer adoption is given that there's more consistency of the features when it comes to Apple Intelligence across the board? And I have a follow-up. Thank you.
Tim Cook: It's tough to answer your question, because we've been constrained in October on the Pro and the Pro Max. And so, it's really too early in the curve to call the precise mix on the consumer versus the Pro. So, we'll see.
Samik Chatterjee: Okay. And for my follow-up, Tim, during the quarter I think over the last 90 days, we had the quotes come out in relation to the DOJ relative to the Google sort of revenue sharing agreement that you have with them. How do you sort of look at it going forward in terms of emphasizing the role that Apple has in that ecosystem with Safari and sort of the potential outcomes that you're looking at? Thank you.
Tim Cook: I don't want to speculate on that from a legal point of view. It's an ongoing case, and I will save that for another day.
Samik Chatterjee: Okay. Thank you. I'll leave it there. Thank you.
Suhasini Chandramouli: All right. Thank you, Samik. Operator, may we have the next question, please?
Operator: Our next question comes from Richard Kramer with Arete Research. Please go ahead.
Richard Kramer: Thanks very much. My first one, Tim, I'd like to ask about some of the components in Services where despite your installed base, some parts of the Apple One bundle, like Music and News and Arcade and Fitness, are not obviously the market-leading offerings. And maybe what might change that and what other services could you call out as growing faster, having wider -- widening addressable markets like we've seen in pay or advertising?
Tim Cook: The way that I view it is that we have lots of opportunity in all of those. And so, there's lots of customers to try to convince to take advantage of it, and we're going to continue investing in the Services and adding new features and -- whether it's News+ or Music or Arcade, that's what we're going to do. Keep in mind that for us, we're more focused on being best than being most. And so, in some cases, not in every case, some of the services that you -- the majority of the services that you mentioned are not cross platform. We make them for our customers only and so that in some cases changes the person who's going to sell the most perhaps, but that's -- our objective is to make the best.
Richard Kramer: Okay, thanks. And then, Luca, one piece of unfinished business was your pledge to get to a net-neutral cash position. And over the last two years, you stayed around $50 billion of net cash. We've clearly seen instances in the past where elevated marketing spend or other programs brought increases in market share. I guess my question looking back on your tenure is, at your scale now of $57 billion of OpEx, do you still see incremental ways to put that cash to work in the business? Or will we just continue to see increased shareholder returns?
Luca Maestri: Well, obviously, as you've seen, our OpEx has gone up over the years. We've also seen at the same time a significant expansion in gross margin, maybe to a level that I would have not expected a few years ago, but we've done a very good job on a number of fronts. And so, I would say we -- when we plan -- every time we plan for the upcoming year, we think about all the different areas where we can deploy our resources and we make them available to grow the business. I think we've done very well over the long term and -- but our fundamental philosophy is to look after the business first. And then, if we have excess cash, we will continue to return it to our shareholders and the plan has worked quite well so far.
Richard Kramer: Okay. Thank you very much.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Richard. We'll take our last question, please, operator?
Operator: Our last question comes from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead.
Atif Malik: Thank you for squeezing me in. It seems to us that the spec differentiation between iPhone 16 Pro and base model isn't as big as prior years. All iPhones have new A18, A18 Pro chips and there wasn't an increase in ASPs versus last year. Can you share with us if there is a shift in your strategy in terms of...
Operator: Unfortunately, Mr. Malik's line has dropped.
Suhasini Chandramouli: All right. Sorry, Atif. We'll connect offline. Thank you, everybody. A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks on Apple Podcasts as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone. The number for the telephone replay is 866-583-1035.

Operator: Once again, this does conclude today's conference. We do appreciate your participation.",2024-10-31
AAPL,2025,1,2025-Q1-AAPL,"Suhasini Chandramouli: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Apple Q1 Fiscal Year 2025 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Suhasini Chandramouli, Director of Investor Relations. Today's call is being recorded. Speaking first today are Apple CEO, Tim Cook, and he will be followed by CFO, Kevan Parekh. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook, including the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions on the company's business and results of operations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.
Tim Cook: Thank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Before I talk about our results I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the devastating wildfires that impacted the Los Angeles area this month. From our retail teams to Apple TV+, Apple Music, Fitness Plus, Beats and more LA is home to many of our team members. Our thoughts are with everyone who is beginning the road to recovery. For our part, we are contributing to the relief efforts and we will continue to support our teams and the local community. Now turning to the quarter. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $124.3 billion for the December quarter, up 4% from a year ago, and an all-time record. EPS also set an all-time record of $2.40, 10% higher year-over-year. We achieved all-time revenue records across the majority of the countries and regions we track, including the Americas, Europe, Japan, and the rest of Asia Pacific. We also continue to see momentum in emerging markets, setting all-time revenue records in a number of markets, including Latin America, the Middle East, and South Asia, among others. In services, we achieved an all-time revenue record, and in the past year, we've seen nearly $100 billion in revenue from our services business. I'm also pleased to announce that we reached a new record for our installed base with over 2.35 billion active devices. In October, we released the first set of Apple Intelligence features in U.S. English for iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and we rolled out more features and expanded to more countries in December. Now users can discover the benefits of these new features in the things they do every day. They can use writing tools to help find just the right words, create fun and unique images with Image Playground and Genmoji, handle daily tasks and seek out information with a more natural and conversational Siri, create movies of their memories with a simple prompt, and touch up their photos with clean up. We introduced visual intelligence with camera control to help users instantly learn about their surroundings. Users can also seamlessly access chat GPT across iOS, iPadOS and MacOS. And we were excited to recently begin our international expansion with Apple Intelligence now available in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the U.K. We're working hard to take Apple Intelligence even further. In April, we're bringing Apple Intelligence to more languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and simplified Chinese, as well as localized English to Singapore and India. And we'll continue to roll out more features in the future, including an even more capable Siri. Apple Intelligence builds on years of innovations we've made across hardware and software to transform how users experience our products. Apple Intelligence also empowers users by delivering personal context that's relevant to them. And importantly, Apple Intelligence is a breakthrough for privacy and AI with innovations like Private Cloud Compute, which extends the industry-leading security and privacy of Apple devices into the cloud. Apple Intelligence opens up an exciting new frontier and is already elevating experiences across iPhone, iPad, and Mac. We're going to keep investing in innovation and in transformative tools that help users in their everyday lives. Let me now turn to our results for the quarter, starting with iPhone. iPhone revenue came in at $69.1 billion, reaching all-time iPhone revenue records in dozens of markets and regions. Our iPhone 16 lineup takes the smartphone experience to the next level in so many ways, and Apple Intelligence is one of many reasons why customers are excited. With the A18 powered iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, users are getting a big boost in battery life and incredible camera experiences with camera control. Our amazingly powerful iPhone 16 Pro models go even further with larger-than-ever displays and a pro camera system so advanced it can turn moments into masterpieces. In Mac, revenue was $9 billion for the December quarter, 16% higher year-over-year, driven by significant excitement around the world for our latest Mac lineup. The Mac is more than just a powerful tool. It's a launchpad to enable users to bring their best ideas and boldest creations to life. And there are so many reasons to choose Mac, from the breathtaking performance of the M4 family of chips to the groundbreaking and growing capabilities of Apple Intelligence. Every product in the Mac lineup offers something extraordinary, whether that's the super portable MacBook Air, the powerhouse MacBook Pro, the world's best all-in-one iMac, or the small wonder that is the Mac Mini, which is not only stunningly capable, but is our first carbon neutral Mac. All of this is enabled by the unparalleled power of Apple Silicon. iPad revenue was $8.1 billion, up 15% from a year ago, driven by strong interest for our latest products. We love hearing from customers, who are discovering for the first time the versatility of iPad from the ultra-portal iPad Mini, built from the ground up for Apple intelligence, to the powerful M4 iPad Pro in a stunningly thin and light design. iPad is there for our users whenever they need it and wherever they go and we are pleased to see so much excitement and enthusiasm for our lineup. Wearables home and accessories revenue came in at $11.7 billion. With its most advanced display yet and a thinner more comfortable design, the all-new Apple Watch Series 10 is the perfect companion to help users pursue their health and fitness goals this year. From the powerful Vitals app to more customizable activity rings, users have an ever-increasing set of innovative health tools at their fingertips and watchOS 11. Health innovation has long been a focus for us, and we're committed to continuing to advance this work, because we know how much it matters to our users. We've introduced new hearing health features on AirPods Pro 2, and new sleep apnea notifications on Apple Watch are also helping users learn of a potentially serious condition that's thought to affect up to a billion people worldwide. During the quarter, we also brought Apple Vision Pro to even more countries, enabling more customers to discover the magic of spatial computing. Users are enjoying incredible immersive entertainment experiences and powerful new features and enhancements to Mac virtual display. Vision Pro is also supercharging the creative process and the incredibly talented director John M. Chu recently shared how its extraordinary capabilities helped him bring the movie Wicked to life. Turning to services, we set an all-time revenue record of $26.3 billion for the December quarter, growing 14% from a year ago. We set all-time records in the Americas, Europe, and rest of Asia-Pacific, and a December quarter record in Japan. Five years since launch, Apple TV+ continues to be home to incredible storytelling that viewers love. There's nothing quite like the anticipation that comes when a fan favorite returns, and we were thrilled to debut the second season of Severance earlier this month. We have so much in store for our subscribers this year with new shows like The Studio and Your Friends and Neighbors. And we can't wait for the premiere of Formula 1 starring Brad Pitt on June 27, which will take viewers inside the sport in a truly unprecedented way. We're excited that Apple TV+ continues to draw attention and accolades. To-date, Apple TV+ productions have earned more than 2,500 nominations and 538 wins. During the quarter, we were also excited to launch a new Find My Service that can help our users when they lose their luggage. For the first time, if you put an air tag in your suitcase, you'll be able to share its location information with many major airlines, so they can quickly track down your bags if they get lost. Turning to retail, our teams went above and beyond to help customers find the perfect gift throughout the holiday season. We also celebrated openings of new stores in China, Spain, and the U.S. and we were excited to announce plans to connect with even more customers this year by adding a fifth store in the UAE and bringing our online store to Saudi Arabia this summer. We can't wait to welcome customers to the first of several flagship store locations in Saudi Arabia that were opening beginning in 2026. I just had the chance to visit both countries last month, and I had a great time meeting with customers and team members. There's an incredible energy and passion for technology in these growing markets. Every day, I get deeply moving notes about the many ways our technology is enriching our users' lives. I recently got a note from a customer who put his watch on his father's wrist when he feared something was wrong with him. The watch alerted them that the father was an AFib and they were able to get him to the hospital for potentially life-saving treatment. Another user put his new watch on for the first time and within 15 minutes was notified of a low heart rate that led to a necessary pacemaker. And there are so many touching notes around the profound impact of our new hearing health feature like a recent user who told me it had changed her life, allowing her to take part in conversations with her children and grandchildren. These are the kind of stories that remind us of how profoundly important our work is, and it drives us to innovate each and every day. At Apple, the future is full of promise and potential. We're always searching across a world of possibilities, finding those places where we can do the most good and putting all of our energy and ingenuity into making something special. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin.
Kevan Parekh: Thanks Tim, and good afternoon everyone. I'm going to cover the results for the first quarter of our fiscal year. We are very pleased to report an all-time high for revenue with December quarter revenue of $124.3 billion, up 4% year-over-year. We achieved all-time revenue records in the Americas, Europe, Japan, and rest of Asia Pacific and grew in the vast majority of markets we track. Products revenue was $98 billion, up 2% year-over-year, driven by growth from iPad and Mac. Thanks to our incredible customer satisfaction and strong loyalty, our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and geographic segments and is now over 2.35 billion active devices. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $26.3 billion, up 14% year-over-year. We grew in every geographic segment and achieved all-time records in both developed and emerging markets. Company gross margin was 46.9% at the high-end of our guidance range and up 70 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by favorable mix. Products gross margin was 39.3%, up 300 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by favorable mix and leverage. Services gross margin was 75%, up 100 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by mix. Operating expenses of $15.4 billion landed at the midpoint of our guidance range and up 7% year-over-year. This strong business performance resulted in all-time records for both net income at $36.3 billion and diluted earnings per share of $2.40, up 10% year-over-year. Operating cash flow was also strong at $29.9 billion, which included the impact of the $11.9 billion we paid during the quarter in connection with the state aid decision. Now, I'm going to provide some more details for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $69.1 billion, roughly flat to the prior year. We grew in the majority of markets we track and reached all-time revenue records in several developed markets, including Canada, Western Europe, and Japan and in emerging markets like Latin America, the Middle East, and South Asia. The iPhone Active installed base grew to an all-time high in total in an average geographic segment. We also set an all-time record for upgraders. According to a recent survey from Kantar during the December quarter, iPhone was a top-selling model in the U.S., Urban China, India, the U.K., France, Australia, and Japan. We continue to see high levels of customer satisfaction in the U.S. at 96% as measured by 451 research. Mac generated $9 billion in revenue, up 16% year-over-year. We saw strength across our lineup from the new Mac Mini to the latest MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models. This incredible performance was broad-based with double-digit growth in every geographic segment. With our latest advances in Apple Silicon and our fastest neural engine ever, customers are able to take advantage of the full capabilities of AI and Mac. The Mac installed base reached an all-time high and we saw a double-digit growth for both upgraders and customers new to the Mac. Additionally, customer satisfaction in the U.S. was recently measured at 94%. iPad revenue was $8.1 billion, up 15% year-over-year, driven by the new iPad Mini and latest iPad Air. The iPad installed base reached another all-time high, and over half of the customers who purchased an iPad during the quarter were new to the product. Customer satisfaction was at 96% in the U.S. based on the latest reports from 451 Research. Wearable's home and accessories revenue was $11.7 billion, down 2% year-over-year. Customers are excited about the new AirPods 4 and the latest hearing health features in AirPods Pro 2. On watch, although we face a difficult compare against the watch Ultra 2 launch last year, the Apple Watch installed base reached a new all-time high, with over half of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. Customer satisfaction for watch in the U.S. was reported at 94%. Our services revenue reached an all-time high of $26.3 billion, up 14% year-over-year. Services continues to see strong momentum, and the growth of our installed base of active devices gives us great opportunities for the future. We also see increased customer engagement with our services offerings. Both transacting and paid accounts reached new all-time highs, with paid accounts growing double-digits year-over-year. Paid subscriptions also grew double-digits. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform. We remain focused on improving the breadth and quality of our services offerings, from new games on Apple Arcade to exciting new programming on Fitness Plus, and the continued expansion of features like Tap to Pay, now live in 20 markets. Turning to enterprise, we have seen businesses continue to expand their deployments of our products and services. Deutsche Bank launched its Mac as Choice program for the developers and also issued the latest MacBook Air as a standard computer for their entire mortgage lending division. And we're excited to see leading enterprises such as SAP leverage Apple Intelligence in the U.S., with features like writing tools, summarize, and priority notifications to enhance both their employee and customer experiences. We also see strong demand in our emerging markets. For example, Zomato, a leading food ordering and delivery company in India, has deployed 1,000 of Macs across their workforce to foster innovation. In Vision Pro continues to see more use cases in enterprise, with Cisco's new spatial meetings delivering a fully immersive video conferencing experience for remote collaboration and learning. Let me quickly summarize our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $141 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $1 billion in maturing debt and decreased commercial paper by $8 billion, resulting in $97 billion in total debt. Therefore, net cash at the end of the quarter was $45 billion. During the quarter, we returned over $30 billion to shareholders. This included $3.9 billion in dividends and equivalents and $23.3 billion through open market repurchases of 100 million Apple shares. As usual, we will provide an update to our capital return program when we report results for the March quarter. As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we're providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we're projecting today for the current quarter. As the dollar is strengthened significantly, we expect foreign exchange to be a headwind and to have a negative impact on revenue of about 2.5 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. Despite that headwind, we expect our March quarter total company revenue to grow low to mid-single-digits year-over-year. We expect services revenue to grow low-double-digits year-over-year. When you remove the negative impact of the foreign exchange headwinds I described earlier, the year-over-year growth rate would be comparable to that of the December quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 46.5% and 47.5%. We expect operating expenses to be between $15.1 billion and $15.3 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $300 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock payable on February 13, 2025, to shareholders of record as of February 10, 2025. With that, let's open to call the questions.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Kevin. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question please?
Operator: Certainly, we will go ahead and take our first question from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Erik Woodring: Great guys, Thanks so much for taking my questions. Tim, in your prepared remarks, you had noted that iPhone 16 models are selling better in markets where Apple Intelligence is available? And I'm just wondering if you could double-click on that comment a bit and share any other details you believe could better help us understand how Apple Intelligence is really impacting iPhone demand and/or what features you find that users are using most often already? And then I just have a quick follow-up. Thank you.
Tim Cook: Yes, Eric. Hi, it's Tim. The -- we did see that the markets where we had rolled out Apple Intelligence, that the year-over-year performance on the iPhone 16 family was stronger than those where Apple Intelligence was not available. In terms of the features that people are using, they're using all of the ones that I'd referenced in my opening comments from writing tools to image playground and Genmoji to visual intelligence and more. And so we see all of those being used. The cleanup is another one that is popular and people love seeing that one demoed in the stores as well. We only had 2, 2.5 weeks or so during the December quarter of the second release of [18.2] (ph) and then only had the U.K. and the other English language countries for the 2.5 weeks. And so we've got just the early indications at the moment, but we were glad…
Erik Woodring: Okay, that's really helpful.
Tim Cook: Yes.
Erik Woodring: Okay, thank you for that, Tim. It's helpful. And then, you know, if we just touch on China, obviously, in the news fairly frequently, if we set aside China Macro, which I understand is still challenging, can you maybe talk about the headwinds that that Apple faces, whether that's, you know, shifting preferences for Western technology brands in favor of domestic vendors, or is this just a function of not necessarily having Apple intelligence available with the iPhone 16, which is, you know, not necessarily helping replacement cycles. Just maybe double clicking on, on what you think and what you're hearing in China as a regard as it relates to the iPhone. Thanks so much.
Tim Cook: Yes, sure. If you look at our greater China revenue for the quarter, we were down 11% year-over-year. And over half of the decline that we experienced was driven by change in channel inventory from the beginning to the end of the quarter. And of course on the Apple intelligence side we have not rolled out in China and as we just talked about we did see better results in the markets that we had rolled out in than markets we hadn't rolled out in. And of course, it's the most competitive market in the world. And so all of those things are true. In terms of the macro situation, there was a fiscal stimulus or subsidy announced in very recently in January that did not affect the December quarter. There were some provincial subsidies in the December quarter, but the national program was announced, I believe, on January 20. And it does cover the categories that we have products in from smartphones to tablets and PCs and smart watches up to a certain, a maximum price point. And so we do see fiscal stimulus occurring and we'll be glad to talk about what that looks like on the next call.
Erik Woodring: Great. Thanks so much, Tim. Good luck.
Tim Cook: Thank you.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Eric. Operator, can we have the next question, please?
Operator: Our next question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius. Please go ahead.
Ben Reitzes: Hey, guys. Thanks a lot for the question. And, hey, Tim, I wanted to ask you who -- you knew this one was coming, but there's a perception that you're a big beneficiary of lower cost of compute and I was wondering if you could give your worldly perspective here on the DeepSeek situation and if you are going to, if you, if anything's happened to change your views in terms of a tailwind to margins and your ability to execute even due to the potential for cost to come down due to that development and probably what was going to happen anyway. But I'd love your perspective on that and then have a quick follow-up. Thanks.
Tim Cook: Sure. In general, I think innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing. And that's what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well. As you know, we do things on the device, and we do things in the private cloud and which mimics from a architectural point of view the -- what happens on the device. And from a CapEx point of view, we've always taken a very prudent and deliberate approach to our expenditure and we continue to leverage a hybrid model, which I think continues to serve us well.
Ben Reitzes: Oh, great. All right. Thanks, Tim. And then, you know, just with regard to, you know, the iPhone trajectory, do you feel like, I guess, what is -- you obviously don't talk about new products and stuff like that, but do you feel that there's a lot of room for form factor innovation in the future? Or do you feel that the current lineup kind of it shows where you're going? I guess without pulling punches wondering if you, you thought you know in terms of the phone innovation if there's a lot more to come and you could see the kind of current market changing a bit over the next two to three years. Thanks.
Tim Cook: I think, Ben, I think there's a lot more to come and I could not feel more optimistic about our product pipeline. So I think there's a lot of innovation left on the smartphone.
Ben Reitzes: Thanks a lot, Tim.
Tim Cook: Yes, thank you.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Ben. Operator, could we have the next question, please?
Operator: Our next question is from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Michael Ng: Good afternoon. Thank you for the question. I have two as well. First, it was encouraging to hear about the record for iPhone upgraders, which I think is something you haven't said for about a year now. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you would attribute this upgrade strength to? Has Apple Intelligence played a role in helping upgrades in the markets that you've launched in? Thanks.
Tim Cook: Yes, thank you for the question. If you look at iPhone, we did set an all-time record for upgraders, so we've never seen a higher level of upgraders before. The installed base hit a new all-time high as well. And if you look at the 16, compared to the 15 from launch, which occurred, as you know, in September, so this is across now two quarters from September to the end of the December fiscal quarter, the 16 outperformed the 15. And so I think you can conclude from that, that there are compelling reasons to upgrade. And in the markets where we had launched Apple Intelligence, they outperformed the markets that we did not. So lots…
Michael Ng: Great, thank you, Tim. That's…
Tim Cook: Yes, lots of good color there.
Michael Ng: Great, thank you, Tim. That's very clear. And then I had one about the iPad Pro and for the thinner version. I was just wondering if you could talk about that thin form factor for the iPad Pro. How did it help iPad sales overall and what did your kind of marketing consumer research tell you about how consumers valued that thin product form factor? Thank you.
Tim Cook: It's a good question. iPad overall grew 15% for the quarter and it was more driven by iPad Air and the entry level iPad than it was the top level iPad. But overall we could not be more pleased with the iPad category growing 15%. It's a great achievement for the quarter. And probably what is most important is that over half of the sales in the December quarter went to customers who were new to the iPad. So that tells us that there's a good amount of customers there to attract.
Michael Ng: Thank you very much, Tim.
Tim Cook: Yes. Thank you.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Mike. Operator, could we have the next question, please?
Operator: Our next question is from Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Please go ahead.
Amit Daryanani: Good afternoon, everyone. I have two as well. Maybe to start with, you folks are seeing some very robust growth trends in emerging markets right now for Apple products? Can you just add a high level, just talk about the durability of growth that you see in emerging markets? And then do you think the summation of these emerging markets are starting to get big enough or perhaps starting to grow fast enough that it can actually offset some of the China headwinds you're going through?
Tim Cook: We have great results in a number of emerging markets. And as you know from past calls, I'm particularly keen on India. India set a December quarter record during the quarter. And we're opening more stores there. We've announced that we're going to open four new stores there. We also, the iPhone was the top selling model in India for the quarter. And it's the second largest smartphone market in the world and the third largest for PCs and tablets and so there's a huge market and we are -- we have very modest share in these markets. And so I think there's lots of upside there. And that's just one of the emerging markets.
Kevan Parekh: Yes, maybe I'll add, Amit, that in emerging markets we're also seeing double-digit growth on the install base, both in total and for the iPhone as well. So that's also an encouraging sign.
Amit Daryanani: Perfect. Thank you. And then, you know, just a question on gross margins for the March quarter. You folks are guiding gross margin is flattish on a sequential basis. Typically, I think it tends to be guided up a little bit, 50 basis points, so sequentially. Can we just touch on like, what are the offsets of the puts and takes you see here on gross margins? And Kevan, maybe you can just talked about its FX having an outsized impact in your margin profile as well in March?
Kevan Parekh: Yes, Amit, let me take that One. You know, as we mentioned in my remarks, we're guiding to 46.5% to 47.5%. So we think it's, you know, we're very pleased with that level of guidance. As you mentioned, there's always puts and takes. We do think there's going to be some FX headwinds, which we talked about, that's going to affect, you know, our revenue growth as well. You know, it'll have an impact here on the margin, a sequential impact on margins. But we think that's going to be offset by favorable costs and the relative mix of services. We also, as you know, when we move from Q1 to Q2, especially on the product side, because Q1 is such a large quarter for a products business, we do have a loss of leverage. So there are some puts and takes, and I think we feel good about the range. We think it's a very, very strong guide for gross margin.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Amit. Operator, could we get the next question, please?
Operator: Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Wamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you so much. Tim, I want to follow-up on your comment about channel inventory in China. I was wondering if you could maybe address more broadly if channel inventory across your different product lines and regions? Do you feel they're elevated or out of range in any other regions? And given the clearing event that kind of happened in China, I guess in the quarter, should we think of a more normal progression quarter-on-quarter into the March quarter in China in particular, and I will follow.
Tim Cook: Yes, I don't want to project sales for the current quarter by region, but if you if you look at the channel inventory and look at iPhone in the aggregate, so on a worldwide basis we're very comfortable with our channel inventory position in the -- in China my point was that our channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter, and that was over half of the reduction in the reported results. And so if you look, part of the reason for that is that our sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter. And so we ended a little leaner than we had expected to.
Wamsi Mohan: Okay, that's very clear. Thank you.
Tim Cook: Yes, thank you.
Wamsi Mohan: And then maybe as my follow-up, your services growth has been very strong and I know you've kind of been navigating some pretty challenging regulatory burdens on the business globally. So how should investors think about maybe either a top line or margin headwind that let's say you're currently absorbing in your results that could potentially maybe reverse in a more balanced regulatory environment? Thank you so much.
Kevan Parekh: Yes. So I think one, I just wanted to kind of reiterate the fact that, you know, our services business had an all-time record for December quarter of 14%. And that was a one strength that we saw across all geographic segments and also was very broad base across all of our services. So we have, as you know, a very broad services portfolio. And so we do see, you know, good momentum across the board. And as well, we continue to see increasing engagement across the customer base, across all of the service offerings, both transacting and paid accounts. We talked about reaching all-time highs, and we have over now 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services platform.
Suhasini Chandramouli: All right. Thanks, Wamsi. Operator, could we get the next question, please?
Operator: Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Samik Chatterjee: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess for the first one, if I -- I mean, you had a great quarter on Macs and iPads both. And I'm just curious, in terms of if you can help us think about the sustainability of this double-digit growth that you saw in both the product lines, and more interest are also here, we are talking about Apple Intelligence sort of influencing volumes on iPhones, but any thoughts on sort of how -- what does that influence look like in terms of volumes for Macs, for example, where I think there's a lot of conversation on AI PCs, how you're thinking about the impact there? And I have a quick follow-up. Thank you.
Tim Cook: Yes. If you look at Mac, Mac was up 16% and on iPad, we were up 15%. The Mac was driven by the very strong uptake on our new products during the quarter and the continued success of the MacBook Air. And so as you know, we've launched an M4-based MacBook Pro, an iMac and a Mac Mini during the quarter. We believe we've got the best AI PC out there for running workloads. The silicon in the Mac is, and it has been for several years now, designed by us and really designed for these workloads. And so I don't want to project at the category level for the future, but we're incredibly pleased with both the Mac and the iPad for the quarter.
Samik Chatterjee: Okay. And Tim, I'm going to use your earlier discussion about India as a strong emerging market to sort of ask you about the supply chain planning there in terms of how much of the supply chain planning there that you're doing is more of a reflection of the growth expectations from that market relative to in terms of diversification of the supply chain? And how should we sort of think about that strategy in terms of that particular country? Thank you.
Tim Cook: Yes. If you look at the manufacturing we do there, we do manufacturing both for the domestic market, and we export. And so in -- our business needs a certain economies of scale for it to make sense to manufacture in country. And so that really means that we're going to be both a use for the domestic market and an export market.
Samik Chatterjee: Great. Thank you.
Tim Cook: Yes, thanks.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Samik. Operator, could we get the next question, please?
Operator: Our next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.
David Vogt: Great, thanks, guys, for taking my question. So maybe, Tim, this is for you. I'm trying to think about your commentary around Apple Intelligence being sort of a momentum driver for the iPhone business. But when I think about your kind of framework for the March quarter, if I kind of adjust for channel inventory over the last couple of years, kind of, feels like your iPhone revenue for the March quarter is going to be relatively similar to the quarter two years ago and even the quarter last year? So how do we square kind of the momentum versus kind of the iPhone business effectively really kind of unchanged over the last couple of years? And then second, when I think about kind of the gross margin profile of the business, obviously, you've done a great job in taking gross margins up. Where do you think we sit in terms of, on the services side at least, where margins could go? It looks like the 75% margin has been incredibly successful quarter. But just trying to get a sense for where do you think this number could go over the intermediate term? Thank you.
Tim Cook: Yes. If you look at Apple Intelligence, what my point earlier was, that markets where we had rolled out Apple Intelligence during the Q1 period performed better on a year-over-year basis than markets where we had not. And so that gives us -- it's a positive indicator that we were pleased with. There are many compelling reasons to upgrade. And the other thing I would say, that I think I mentioned earlier, is that if you look at it from a launch to the end of the December quarter, and so that goes back to September, the 16 family is outperforming the 15 family. And so I think those are two good data points. Our next round of language rollouts will be in April. And so it will be at the -- in our Q3 quarter. And I'll let Kevan take the gross margin question.
David Vogt: Yes, great.
Kevan Parekh: Hi, David. How are you? So on the Services gross margin, I think maybe just stepping back a second. Services business in general in aggregate is accretive to the overall company margin. And one of the things, as an important reminder, is we've got a very broad services portfolio. And those businesses have very different margin profiles. And so I think, one, it's because of the nature of those businesses and in part also because of the way we account for them. And so one of the big factors that drive the Services gross margins and relative performance of those different businesses within the portfolio. We also have the dynamic of some scale businesses like payment services, iCloud, that are actually growing. And there, when we add incremental users, those end up being accretive to margins as well. And so in general, what we saw in the December quarter was nice momentum across our entire services business that allows us to deliver that 75% margin at the services level. And I think our guidance takes into consideration what we think we're going to land from a company standpoint of 46.5% to 47.5%, which again, we think is a strong guide.
David Vogt: Great, thanks, guys.
Suhasini Chandramouli: All right, thank you, David. Operator, could we have the next question, please?
Operator: Our next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Krish Sankar: Yes, thanks for taking my question. I also had two of them. One, the first one for Tim. You had very strong Mac growth, 16% year-over-year last quarter. Just wondering how much of that was driven by some of the Mac silicon innovation versus a replacement cycle for Macs?
Tim Cook: I don't know the answer to your question precisely, but I think it is a combination of these products are so compelling, the M4-based products are so compelling, that it's driving both upgrades at the double-digit level and it's driving switchers at a double-digit level. And so we're seeing both come out, and I think it's just because of the compelling products.
Krish Sankar: Got it. Got it. Thanks for that, Tim. And then a follow-up for Kevan on the gross margin. I want to ask you on the product side. Last quarter, you had 39.3%, which is very strong, similar to a year ago period. I'm kind of curious how much more levels do you have on the product side to improve the gross margin? Or do you think with some of the more new AI-related devices, there's more upside to gross margin from here on the product hardware side?
Kevan Parekh: Yes. Thanks, Krish, for the question. So on the product side, as you mentioned, we had pretty strong sequential improvement, 300 basis points, for the December quarter. That was really driven by, we talked about, favorable mix and leverage. As you know, in Q1, again, it's a launch quarter for many products, and so we tend to benefit from the leverage that we get from that higher volume. I would say, in general, our gross margin on products is driven by a number of factors. One of them is the various product launches that we have. Different products do have different margin profiles. And so that mix does make a difference. And in particular, what we're seeing is, for example, many of our mix is across like phone, for example, we're seeing customers gravitate towards our Pro products because of things like affordability that allows our customers to get into our best products, which have favorable gross margins. So we're continuing to see that trend, that impacted us in the December quarter. As well, I think we're in a favorable commodity environment from a cost standpoint. And so we're benefiting from that as well in the December quarter. And then that's going to be, as we talked about, we're going to have a foreign exchange headwind heading into the March quarter, but we figured that's contemplated in the guidance range that we gave, the 46.5% to 47.5%.
Krish Sankar: Thanks, Kevan. Thanks, Tim.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Krish. Operator, could we get the next question, please?
Operator: Our next question is from Richard Kramer with Arete Research. Please go ahead.
Richard Kramer: Thanks very much. My first question is for Tim. I'd like to ask about what might accelerate the pace of Apple Intelligence adoption. I guess do you see this simply as a question of time i.e., to launch more markets and languages or increase the percentage of installed base devices that can support it? Or is it a question of money, i.e., shifting R&D or marketing spend towards AI? And based on other prior Apple services, do you expect a sort of tipping point where adoption will go mainstream? Thanks.
Tim Cook: I do believe it will go mainstream. I'm getting feedback from people using different features today. And this is -- keep in mind that on the iPhone side of our business, you either have to have an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 16 to use Apple Intelligence. And so the -- as that base grows, I think the usage will continue to grow. And I think -- I know from my own personal experience, once you start using the features, you can't imagine not using them anymore. I know I get 100s of e-mails a day, and the summarization function is so important. So I think it's a combination of that. And of course, in April, we roll out a whole series of new languages that we had mentioned, and so the base grows further.
Richard Kramer: Okay, thank you. And then, Kevan, one of Luca's legacies was really getting Apple to record margin levels and also maintaining very consistent pricing across the product range. But taking the current high levels of profitability as fairly stable, what observations might you share about price sensitivity of users and whether having a wider range of pricing across the products might unlocks potentially further market share gains or boost overall product growth?
Kevan Parekh: Yes, it's a good question. I think one, I don't think we're going to really depart from what served us pretty well to now. I mean we always take it into consideration, looking at short-term -- comparison between the short term and the long term. I think we've had a pretty disciplined pricing strategy, which would serve us pretty well. And I think we're going to continually kind of stick with that as far as I can tell.
Richard Kramer: Okay, thanks.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Richard. Operator, could we get the next question, please?
Operator: Our next question is from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead.
Atif Malik: Hi, thank you for taking my question. How do you guys see the potential tariff impact to your product for consumer demand under Trump 2.0 you guys did find under Trump 1.0?
Tim Cook: We are monitoring the situation and don't have anything more to add than that.
Atif Malik: Great. And Tim, as a follow-up, there is a lot of discussion on agentic AI, the use of agents. Do you guys see the upgraded series expected in April as something that will, let's say, be the killer application among the suite of features that you have announced in Apple Intelligence?
Tim Cook: I think the killer feature is different for different people. But I think for most, they're going to find that they're going to use many of the features every day. And certainly, one of those is the -- is Siri, and that will be coming over the next several months.
Atif Malik: Thank you.
Suhasini Chandramouli: All right. Thank you, Atif. Operator, could we please get the last question?
Operator: Our last question is from Ben Bollin from Cleveland Research Company. Please go ahead.
Ben Bollin: Good evening, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Tim, I'm interested in your thoughts and how you would have us think about the average useful life of these devices in the wild. And in particular, curious, if you look at the strength you saw in fiscal ‘21 and how that might support accelerated refresh opportunity into the future?
Tim Cook: Yes. Ben, I think it's different for different types of users. I mean you have very early adopter kind of users that are very quick to jump on the latest technology that upgrade very frequently. And then you have people that are on the entire opposite side of that barbell. And most people are between those two points. And so I do think there were lots of units that are sold during the COVID period of time, and it's a huge opportunity for us as a company to -- for more than one of the product categories.
Ben Bollin: That’s it from me. Thanks, Tim.
Tim Cook: Thank you.
Suhasini Chandramouli: All right. Thanks, Ben. A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks on Apple Podcasts or as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone.

AAPL,2025,2,2025-Q2-AAPL,"Suhasini Chandramouli: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Apple Q2 Fiscal Year 2025 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Suhasini Chandramouli, Director of Investor Relations. Today's call is being recorded. Speaking first today is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook; and he'll be followed by CFO, Kevan Parekh. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook, including the potential impact of tariffs and other trade measures and macroeconomic conditions on the company's business and results of operations.

Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.
Tim Cook: Thank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, we are reporting 95.4 billion in revenue, up 5% from a year ago and at the high end of the range we provided last quarter. Diluted EPS was $1.65, up 8% year-over-year and a March quarter record. Services achieved an all-time revenue record, growing 12% compared to the prior year. We also set a number of quarterly records in countries and regions across the world, including the UK, Spain, Finland, Brazil, Chile, Turkey, Poland, India, and the Philippines. We are as dedicated as ever to the innovation and ingenuity that will enrich our customers' lives and help us leave the world better than we found it. And we are proud to increase our impact around the world, including here in the United States, where we recently announced plans to spend $500 billion over the next four years. We're going to be expanding our teams in our facilities in several states, including Michigan, Texas, California, Arizona, Nevada, Iowa, Oregon, North Carolina, and Washington. And we're going to be opening a new factory for advanced server manufacturing in Texas. During calendar year 2025, we expect to source more than 19 billion chips from a dozen states, including tens of millions of advanced chips being made in Arizona this year. We also source glass used in iPhone from an American company. All told, we have more than 9,000 suppliers in the U.S. across all 50 states. Now I'll turn to products, starting with iPhone. iPhone revenue was $46.8 billion, up 2% from a year ago. During the quarter, we introduced iPhone 16e, a great new entry-level addition to our iPhone 16 lineup. It's powered by our latest generation A18 chip and includes the all-new Apple-designed C1 modem, the most energy-efficient modem ever in an iPhone, allowing iPhone 16e to have the longest battery life of any 6.1-inch iPhone. Meanwhile, iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus users are exploring how they can use Camera Control, whether capturing stunning images or exploring the world with Visual Intelligence. And our iPhone 16 Pro models continue to be a hit with our users. They are turbocharged by the remarkable capabilities and efficiency of A18 Pro and feature larger displays, an advanced camera system and a beautiful design. Mac revenue was $7.9 billion, 7% higher year-over-year, another great quarter for Mac. During the quarter, we introduced significant new updates to our lineup. The world's most popular laptop just got even better. The M4-powered MacBook Air features a 12-megapixel Center Stage camera and delivers a massive boost in performance. And now it comes in a beautiful new sky blue color. The new Mac Studio is the most powerful Mac we've ever shipped, equipped with M4 Max and our new M3 Ultra chip. It's a true AI powerhouse capable of running large language models with over 600 billion parameters entirely in memory. Apple Intelligence brings great capabilities to the Mac with features like Writing Tools and Notification Summaries that help users stay focused and get more done. Turning to iPad. Revenue for the quarter was $6.4 billion, up 15% from a year ago, another strong quarter of double digit growth. Our iPad lineup continues to help users learn, work, play, and go wherever their imaginations take them. The new iPad Air with M3 combines powerful performance and exceptional portability, whether you're taking it across the street or around the world. And Apple Intelligence and Apple Pencil Pro are a perfect match, with features like the Clean Up Tool in Photos to remove distractions, and Image Wand in the Notes app to elevate simple sketches into polished illustrations. Across Wearables, Home and Accessories, revenue was $7.5 billion, down 5% from a year ago. From walking trails to bike paths, Apple Watch Series 10 is an essential partner wherever you are on the health and fitness journey. And AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation delivers an extraordinary experience in an open-ear design. Customers continue to tell me how important our Hearing Health features for AirPods Pro 2 are to them, and we've been expanding their availability to reach even more users around the world. Millions have already taken hearing tests and the stories we received about the new hearing aid feature are deeply moving, showing how these innovations are making a real difference in people's daily lives. It's a powerful reminder of the impact technology can have when it's designed with care. Meanwhile, Apple Vision Pro takes the concert experience to a whole new level with Metallica, our latest Apple immersive video, which you have to see to believe. And visionOS 2.4 unlocks the first set of Apple Intelligence features for Vision Pro users while inviting them to explore a curated and regularly updated collection of spatial experiences with the Spatial Gallery app. In retail, in addition to the two stores we opened during the quarter, we're also looking forward to a new retail store in the UAE, the arrival of the online store in Saudi Arabia and new retail stores in India starting later this year. Let's now turn to Services, where we achieved an all-time revenue record of $26.6 billion, up 12% from a year ago with strong performance across all of our categories. From starting their morning with their podcast of choice to buying a coffee with Apple Pay to spending an afternoon reading the latest bestseller on Apple Books to using their favorite app from the App Store or an evening workout with Fitness+, Apple Services are enriching our users' lives all throughout their day. With incredible shows like The Studio, Your Friends & Neighbors and the culture-shaping Severance, Apple TV+ has become a must-see destination with record viewership during the quarter. And we're excited for our upcoming movie F1 starring Brad Pitt, which will hit theaters this summer and gives an incredible inside look at one of the most intense sports on Earth. And there is so much more to come this year. It's no wonder Apple TV+ has earned more than 2,500 award nominations and 560 wins. We're also reaching sports fans in more ways than ever, from watching our favorite teams go to bat on Friday Night Baseball to cheering on their local team with MLS Season Pass to following the results of every Grand Prix with Formula 1 now on the Apple Sports app. Turning to software. We just released iOS 18.4, which brought Apple Intelligence to more languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and simplified Chinese as well as localized English to Singapore and India. AI and machine learning are core to so many profound features we've rolled out over the years to help our users live a better day. It's why we designed Apple Silicon with a neural engine that powers so many AI features across our products and third-party apps. It's also what makes Apple products the best devices for generative AI. At WWDC 24, we announced Apple Intelligence and shared our vision for integrating generative AI across our ecosystem into the apps and features our users rely on every day. To achieve this goal, we built our own highly capable foundation models that are specialized for everyday tasks. We designed helpful features that are right where our users need them and are easy to use. And we went to great lengths to build a system that protects user privacy, whether requests are processed on-device or in the cloud with Private Cloud Compute, an extraordinary step forward for privacy and AI. Since we launched iOS 18, we've released a number of Apple Intelligence features from helpful Writing Tools to Genmoji, Image Playground, Image Wand, Clean Up, Visual Intelligence and a seamless connection to ChatGPT, we made it possible for users to create movies of their memories with a simple prompt and added AI-powered photo search, smart replies, priority notifications, summaries for mail, messages and more. We've also expanded these capabilities to more languages and regions. With regard to the more personal Siri features we announced, we need more time to complete our work on these features so they meet our high-quality bar. We are making progress and we look forward to getting these features into customers' hands. Turning to sustainability. We just celebrated Earth Day, and we were proud to announce that we've cut our emissions by 60% from our 2015 levels. Today, we're using more clean energy across our operations and more recycled materials in our products than ever. We have worked with suppliers to bring 17.8 gigawatts of renewable electricity online. We're also saving billions of gallons of freshwater and redirecting millions of metric tons of waste from landfills. All of this will help us make important progress towards our goal of carbon neutrality across our supply chain and the life cycle of our products by 2030. Now let me walk you through the impacts of tariffs in the March quarter and give you some color on what we expect for the June quarter. For the March quarter, we had a limited impact from tariffs as we were able to optimize our supply chain and inventory. For the June quarter, currently, we are not able to precisely estimate the impact of tariffs as we are uncertain of potential future actions prior to the end of the quarter. However, for some color, assuming the current global tariff rates, policies and applications do not change for the balance of the quarter and no new tariffs are added, we estimate the impact to add $900 million to our costs. This estimate should not be used to make projections for future quarters as there are certain unique factors that benefit the June quarter. For our part, we will manage the company the way we always have, with thoughtful and deliberate decisions, with a focus on investing for the long term, and with dedication to innovation and the possibilities it creates. As we look ahead, we remain confident, confident that we will continue to build the world's best products and services, confident in our ability to innovate and enrich our users' lives, and confident that we can continue to run our business in a way that has always set Apple apart. Next month, we can't wait to welcome our developer community for the Worldwide Developers Conference, and we look forward to revealing some exciting announcements. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevan.
Kevan Parekh: Thanks, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Our March quarter revenue of $95.4 billion was up 5% year-over-year despite a headwind of almost 2.5 percentage points from foreign exchange. We also grew in the majority of the markets we track. Products revenue was $68.7 billion, up 3% year-over-year, driven by growth in iPhone, iPad, and Mac. And thanks to our high levels of customer satisfaction and strong loyalty, our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high across all product categories and geographic segments. Services revenue was $26.6 billion, up 12% year-over-year despite over 2 percentage points of foreign exchange headwinds. And as Tim mentioned, this was an all-time revenue record. We also grew in every geographic segment and saw double-digit growth in both developed and emerging markets. Company gross margin was 47.1%, in the middle of our guidance range and up 20 basis points sequentially primarily driven by favorable mix. Products gross margin was 35.9%, down 340 basis points sequentially, driven by mix, foreign exchange and a seasonal loss of leverage. Services gross margin was 75.7%, up 70 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by a different mix, partly offset by foreign exchange. Operating expenses landed at $15.3 billion, up 6% year-over-year. Net income was $24.8 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.65, up 8% year-over-year and a March quarter record. Operating cash flow was also strong at $24 billion. Now I'm going to provide some more details for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $46.8 billion, up 2% year- over-year driven by the iPhone 16 family. The iPhone Active installed base grew to an all-time high in total and in every geographic segment, and iPhone upgraders grew double-digits year-over-year. According to a recent survey from Kantar, during the March quarter, iPhone was a top-selling model in the U.S., urban China, the UK, Germany, Australia, and Japan. And we continue to see high levels of customer satisfaction in the U.S. at 97% as measured by 451 Research. Mac revenue was $7.9 billion, up 7% year-over-year, driven by the latest MacBook Air, MacBook Pro and Mac Mini models. This performance was broad-based with every geographic segment growing year-over-year. Mac installed base reached an all-time high and we saw strong growth for both upgraders and customers new to the Mac. Customer satisfaction was reported at 95% in the U.S. iPad revenue was $6.4 billion, up 15% year-over-year, driven by the new M3-powered iPad Air. The iPad installed base reached another all-time high, and over half the customers who purchased an iPad during the quarter were new to the product. Based on the latest reports from 451 Research, customer satisfaction was 97% in the U.S. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $7.5 billion, down 5% year-over-year. Keep in mind, we did face a more difficult compare against the launch of the Apple Vision Pro in the year ago quarter as well as the Watch Ultra 2 launched last year. At the same time, the Apple Watch installed base reached a new all-time high with over half of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. And customer satisfaction for Watch in the U.S. was recently measured at 95%. Our Services revenue reached an all-time high of $26.6 billion, up 12% year-over-year. This growth rate was comparable to the December quarter year-over-year growth rate when we removed the negative impact from foreign exchange. We saw strong momentum in the March quarter and the growth of our installed base of active devices gives us great opportunities for the future. Customer engagement across our Services offerings also continue to grow. Both transacting and paid accounts reached new all-time highs, with paid accounts growing double-digits year-over-year. Paid subscriptions also grew double-digits. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform. We continue to improve the quality and breadth of our service offerings from additional features in News+ to new games available on Arcade. Apple Pay continues to help our customers with an easy, secure and private payment solution, and we were pleased to see that our active users in Apple Pay reached an all-time record, up double-digits year-over-year. Turning to enterprise. Organizations are investing more on Apple products and services to drive productivity and employee engagement. For example, KPMG recently rolled out iPhone 16 for all U.S. employees, reflecting their confidence in Apple's security and privacy features. We also continue to see strong Mac performance in enterprise. New Bank, the largest digital bank in Latin America has selected MacBook Air as a standard computer for their thousands of employees. With Vision Pro, companies are continuing to find new and innovative ways to leverage this technology. Dassault Systèmes, a leading provider for engineering and 3D design software has natively integrated Apple Vision Pro into their next-generation platform, bringing a powerful and immersive spatial experience to thousands of enterprise customers. Now let's turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $133 billion in cash and marketable securities. We had $3 billion in debt maturities and increased commercial paper by $4 billion, resulting in $98 billion in total debt. Therefore, at the end of the quarter, net cash was $35 billion. During the quarter, we returned $29 billion to shareholders. This included $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $25 billion through open market repurchases of 108 million Apple shares. Given the continued confidence we have in our business now and into the future, today, our Board authorized an additional $100 billion for share repurchases as we maintain our goal of getting to net cash neutral. We're also raising our dividend by 4% to $0.26 per share of common stock, and we continue to plan for annual increases in the dividend going forward as we have done for the last 13 years. This cash dividend will be payable on May 15, 2025, to shareholders of record as of May 12, 2025. As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to. Importantly, the color we're providing assumes that global tariff rates, policies and application remain in effect as of this call. And the global macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from today for the current quarter. Despite the overall uncertain environment, we will still be providing color at the total company level, subject to these assumptions and the risk factors that we referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect our June quarter total company revenue to grow low to mid-single digits year-over-year. We expect gross margin to be between 45.5% and 46.5%, which includes the estimated impact of the $900 million of tariff-related costs that Tim referred to earlier. We expect operating expenses to be between $15.3 billion and $15.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $300 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%. With that, let's open the call to questions.
Suhasini Chandramouli: We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?
Operator: Certainly. We'll go ahead and take our first question from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley.
Erik Woodring: Great, thanks so much guys for taking my questions. Tim, I'd love to maybe touch on the tariff point first. There were comments from you earlier on CNBC talking about 50% of iPhones for the U.S. currently coming from India. Where do you expect the mix of India-sourced iPhones for the U.S. to be by the end of your fiscal year? And is it the goal to source 100% of your U.S.-bound iPhones from India? Can you just help us understand kind of how we should expect that to trend as we look beyond just the June quarter? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.
Tim Cook: Yes, Erik, hi. It's Tim. The existing tariffs that apply to Apple today are based on the product's country of origin as you alluded to. For the June quarter, we do expect the majority of iPhones sold in the U.S. will have India as their country of origin and Vietnam to be the country of origin for almost all iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and AirPods products sold in the -- also sold in the U.S. China would continue to be the country of origin for the vast majority of total product sales outside the U.S. And so if you look at the categories of tariffs that are applicable to us today, for the June quarter, most of our tariff exposure relates to the February IEEPA-related tariff at the rate of 20%, which applies to imports to the U.S. for products that have China as their country of origin. In addition, for China, there was an additional 125% tariff for imports of certain categories of products announced in April. And for us, that's some of our U.S. AppleCare and Accessories businesses and brings the total rate in China for these products to at least 145%. Also for transparency and clarity, the vast majority of our products, including iPhone, Mac, iPad, Apple Watch, and Vision Pro, are currently not subject to the global reciprocal tariffs that were announced in April as the Commerce Department has initiated a Section 232 investigation into imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment and downstream products that contain semiconductors. And so if you -- for the June quarter, as I talked about in the -- in my opening comments, we estimate the impact, assuming that the current global tariff, rates, policies and applications don't change for the balance of the quarter, to be 900 million to our costs. I wouldn't want to predict the mix of production in the future, but I wanted to give you clarity for the June quarter of where the country of origins are so you can use that for your modeling.
Erik Woodring: Okay. I appreciate that color. Thank, Tim. And then maybe my follow-up is there were a number of reports during the quarter that Apple had pulled forward sell-in into the channel to get ahead of tariffs. So can you just help us better kind of understand or clarify if sell-in and sell-through were aligned in the March quarter? If you're assuming that they would be aligned in the June quarter guide? And ultimately, do you believe that consumers are accelerating hardware purchases to get ahead of any potential pricing increases or was behavior normal? Thank you so much, Tim.
Tim Cook: Yes. Thanks, Erik, for the question. There are several questions there. One, in terms of the pull forward in demand, if you look at the March quarter, we don't believe that we saw obvious evidence of a significant pull forward in demand in the March quarter due to tariffs. If you look at our channel inventory, from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter, the unit channel inventory was similar, not only for iPhone but for the balance of our products. Again, for transparency, you will see that we did build ahead inventory, and that's reflected in our manufacturing purchase obligations that you'll see on the quarterly filing when it comes out. So I hope that makes the -- answers all your questions.
Erik Woodring: Thank you so much, Tim. Good Luck.
Tim Cook: Thanks.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Eric. Operator, could we have the next question, please?
Operator: Our next question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius. Please go ahead.
Ben Reitzes: Hi, thanks a lot. Tim, if you had told me that on April 2 that your hit from tariffs was only a nickel-ish a quarter at 900 million, that would have been a pretty good outcome, given the panic that ensued. I'm surprised that it's that low. But then you did make a comment about after the June quarter, and sorry to push you on that, but could it be a multiple of that figure or is it just completely unknown? We're all just trying to figure out what happens after June. And if there's just any guidance you guys can possibly give that it's bigger, smaller or what? And hoping you can just give us a little color on that. Thanks.
Tim Cook: Yes, Ben. Thanks for the question. I tried to give you some information in the previous question about the country of origin, which currently is the key factor in determining the tariffs that we're paying. I don't want to predict the future because I'm not sure what will happen with the tariffs, and there is the Section 232 investigation going on. And so it's very difficult to predict beyond June. And June has the assumptions in it that I had mentioned earlier.
Ben Reitzes: All right, Tim. And then just with regard to China down 2%, I mean, you intuitively would have thought there would have been an increased nationalism there and perhaps it would have been worse than that. And the trajectory there improving even with subsidies because subsidies benefited your competitors, too. Just wondering if I could get a little more color there. Can it keep improving? What are you thinking with regard to that trajectory in China, given all the geopolitical tensions? Thanks.
Tim Cook: Yes, we were down 2%, as you point out, for the March quarter. And to provide a little more transparency around that, we were roughly flat when you remove the headwinds from foreign exchange. And so we did see quite a bit of sequential improvement from the December quarter, which was down 11. And again, for going out of the way for transparency, the channel inventory at the end of March, the unit channel inventory was similar to where we started the quarter. So there wasn't a build of channel inventory in there. I do believe that the subsidies played a favorable impact on the results. It's difficult to estimate with precision as to exactly how much, but I think it was positive. Some of our products are included. Some of them are not. Generally, on iPhone, if something is priced above RMB6,000, it is not eligible for the subsidy and the other products have different rules. But I do think it helped. And I think it's helping others as well, I'm sure. iPhone was the key driver of the improvement sequentially. And so hopefully, that provides you some color. The other thing I would say is that the Mac, the iPad, and the Watch are attracting a majority of customers new to that product. And so that continues to look quite good in China. And iPhone was the top two models in urban China, and iPad was the top two tablets in urban China. So there's some positive nuggets there.
Ben Reitzes: Thanks a lot, Tim.
Tim Cook: Yes. Thank you, Ben.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Ben. Operator, may we have the next question, please?
Operator: Our next question is from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Michael Ng: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about your responses on some of this trade policy uncertainty. I appreciated the transparency around building ahead with inventory. Will you continue to do that in this interim period until we get some clarity on Section 232 investigation? And could you talk a little bit about your philosophy on pricing, elevated costs to the extent that comes through, whether that be to resellers or end consumers and other efficiency efforts that you might be able to pursue? Thank you.
Tim Cook: Yes. Obviously, we're very engaged on the tariff discussions. We believe in engagement and we'll continue to engage. On the pricing piece, we have nothing to announce today. And I'll just say that the operational team has done an incredible job around optimizing the supply chain and the inventory. And we'll obviously continue to do those things to the degree that we can.
Michael Ng: Great. Thanks. And just as a quick follow-up for Kevan, on product gross margins, I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on some of the factors that may have impacted product gross margins in the quarter. Obviously, down sequentially on seasonal factors but there was a year-over-year decline as well. So any additional color would be helpful? Thank you.
Kevan Parekh: Yes, Michael, thanks. This is Kevan. So on the sequential, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we had a decrease in the product gross margin by 340 basis points sequentially. That was primarily driven by mix, seasonal loss of leverage, foreign exchange and that was partly offset by cost savings. And when we look at the year-on-year performance, we were down 70 basis points on a year-on- year basis. And that was driven by a different mix and foreign exchange.
Michael Ng: Thank you.
Kevan Parekh: Thank you.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Mike. Operator, could we have the next question, please?
Operator: Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Amit Daryanani: Thanks a lot. I guess I'll have to start with a tariff question as well. Tim, I think when you talked about the 900 million impact to your cost of goods sold, you sort of had a statement that there are certain unique factors that benefit you in the June quarter related to that number. Can you just talk about what are these unique factors that are benefiting you in the June quarter? And what would the impact be without those benefits essentially?
Tim Cook: I wouldn't want to go through all of them. But as an example, the build ahead that is -- I mentioned earlier that's in the manufacturing purchase obligations is -- were helpful.
Amit Daryanani: Got it. And then as I think about the June quarter guide of low to mid-single-digit revenue growth, I was wondering, do you folks expect services growth to remain in the double-digit range as you go into the back half of the year? I imagine FX is a bit of a benefit as you go to the back half. I would love to just understand, within that framework, how do you think services stacks up as you go through the June quarter?
Kevan Parekh: Yes, Amit. Hi, it's Kevan. So I think when we talk about the overall June quarter, we talk about the low to mid-single digits year- over-year. We do expect foreign exchange in the June quarter to improve sequentially. However, we are expecting it to be a slight headwind to revenue on a year-on-year basis. With respect to services, given the uncertainty we see from several factors, we aren't providing the category level of color today.
Amit Daryanani: Got it. Thank you.
Kevan Parekh: Thank you.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Amit. Operator, could we have the next question, please?
Operator: Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Wamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you. Tim or Kevan, how should investors think about the gross margin trajectory as you source more from the U.S. in particular or other supply chain changes that you are making, including in India? How should those kind of play into the cost structure and how should we think about that gross margin trajectory and I will follow-up?
Tim Cook: We're excited about bringing more production to the U.S. As you know, we've been very key in the TSMC project in Arizona and are the largest and first customer getting product out of that. And that's the SoC that's coming out of there. We also have glass coming out of the U.S. and the Face ID module and loads of chips. In fact, there's 19 billion chips coming out across 12 states. This is down to the resistor and capacitor level, obviously. And so there's some that is already built into the margins that Kevan has quoted. And we don't really forecast beyond the current quarter as you know.
Kevan Parekh: Yes, maybe I'll add a couple of more points as we think about just the margin going forward. A couple of observations I'd mention is every product cycle is different and over the years we have managed gross margin well. We've made good decisions balancing units revenue margins. When we launch new products, they tend to have a higher cost structure than the products they replace as we introduce new features and technologies. We do have a good track record of reducing those costs and structures over the life of the product. And our products and services all have different levels of profitability and their relative success in the marketplace has an impact on the overall gross margin. So I hope that's helpful color and context for you.
Wamsi Mohan: No, that's super helpful. Thank you. I guess you just noted that you weren't going to give services maybe a growth forecast here in light of some of the uncertain news. But maybe, Tim, could you share any color around what you have seen in developer behavior in areas like Europe where there has now been emergence of alternate app stores for a little more time? What have you seen anecdotally or within your data in terms of maybe develop a behavior, whether it's large or small? Any color you can share on what has like actually happened?
Tim Cook: It's embedded in our results that Kevan talked about earlier and embedded in the overall company color that was provided. But as you know, the Digital Markets Act went into effect in, I believe it was March of last year. And so the Digital Markets Act has been enacted for a bit over a year and there's been alternate app stores for some period of time of that. And so it's -- at this point in Europe, there are some embedded in the actuals. There may be more to come and so forth. I don't want to predict beyond the current quarter.
Wamsi Mohan: Okay. Thank you, Tim.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Wamsi. Operator, could we have the next question, please?
Operator: Our next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.
David Vogt: Great. Thanks, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So I've got two as well, and Tim, this is more of a big picture supply chain philosophical question. So can you maybe update us on your thoughts on how you're thinking about your resiliency and redundancy, following the change that you guys talked about earlier on the call? I guess what I'm trying to understand is how do we think about where your supply chain is two to three years from now? And is there any risk, at least in the near term, of maybe some export control issues in your outlook for the balance of this year? And I'll give you my second one at the same time. You quantified a $900 million hit from tariffs. Or Kevan, is there any impact in how you're thinking about the demand backdrop in your outlook for the June quarter on the revenue line holistically? Thanks.
Tim Cook: In terms of the resiliency and risk, et cetera, there -- we have a complex supply chain. There's always risk in the supply chain. And so I wouldn't tell you anything different than that. What we learned some time ago was that having everything in one location had too much risk with it. And so we have, over time, with certain parts of the supply chain, not the whole thing, but certain parts of it opened up new sources of supply. And you could see that kind of thing continuing in the future. I'll let Kevan answer the other question.
Kevan Parekh: Hi, David. On the other question, I would say that our best thinking is captured in the outlook that we provided. However, I did want to reemphasize the point that the assumptions we made on the outlook do assume that the global tariff rates, the policies and application remain the same as they are today as of this call and that the global macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from today.
David Vogt: Okay. But no quantifiable impact on demand to date, at least from where we are over the last month? Is there a way to kind of think about that from early April to early May?
Kevan Parekh: I would say our best thinking is reflected in the range that we provided.
David Vogt: Okay. Thanks, Kevan. Thanks, guys.
Kevan Parekh: Thank you.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, David. Operator, could we have the next question, please?
Operator: Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Samik Chatterjee: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, Tim, you made a comment on the last earnings call about Apple Intelligence making a visible impact on iPhone sales in the countries where it was available. I'm just curious if you continue to see that play out similarly in the more broader number of countries you've rolled that out. Or the delays that you talked about related to Siri, personalized Siri features, has that had an impact in terms of consumer willingness to upgrade? And I have a follow-up. Thank you.
Tim Cook: Yes, thank you for the question. During the March quarter, we saw that in markets where we had rolled out Apple Intelligence, that the year-over-year performance on the iPhone 16 family was stronger than those where Apple Intelligence was not available. A lot of the languages that I think you're referring to rolled out in April and so they actually rolled out in Q3.
Samik Chatterjee: Okay, got it. Then maybe for my follow-up, I mean, you have a lot of insights now in terms of what consumers or how consumers are reacting to the overall macro. And I know you prefaced all your guidance with macro remaining consistent. But how -- what are you seeing in terms of the U.S. consumer? And what's the reaction there in terms of the tariff impact? We saw U.S. GDP also shrink here in 1Q. When you look at velocity at the stores or trade down within the iPhone portfolio mix, what are you seeing in terms of how the consumer is reacting to the macro at this point? Thank you.
Tim Cook: I'm not an economist and so I'd start by saying that. In terms of the -- as you can see from a total company point of view, our results accelerated sequentially to the 5% level. And the U.S. is obviously the vast majority of the Americas segment, and you can see how the Americas performed during the quarter. And so that's all I want to say about that. I don't want to try to predict what happens in the months from now. The past, I'm quite pleased with the results from Q2.
Samik Chatterjee: Thank you. Thanks for taking the questions.
Tim Cook: Yes.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Samik. Operator, could we have the next question, please?
Operator: Our next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Krish Sankar: Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two of them, too. Tim, thanks for that information on the $500 billion U.S. investment. I'm kind of curious how to think about the composition of that? How much is CapEx versus R&D? How much is going into like the Texas server? How much is going into maybe TSMC Arizona? Any kind of color you can give on that $500 billion investment would be helpful. And then I had a follow-up.
Tim Cook: Well, there's lots of all of it is what I would say. We're not giving out the exact split, but as we expand facilities in the different states from Michigan to Texas to California and Arizona and Nevada and Iowa and Oregon and North Carolina and Washington, there will be CapEx involved in that and OpEx involved in it. And standing up a server -- advanced server manufacturing in Texas, we did that through a partner. We do our manufacturing through a partner, but we'll be putting a fair amount in cost of goods sold to do that and some OpEx as well, and I'm sure some CapEx as well. And so it's a bit of all of it.
Krish Sankar: Got it, got it. And then kind of had like a long term, more like a philosophical question. When you look at -- in the past, you've spoken about AI on the Edge. Obviously, it's very topical to hear from both the iPhone angle and the Mac angle. But I'm just kind of curious, when you look at AI on Edge, are the current smartphone specs or improved hardware and silicon specs good enough to meet future Edge LLM for inference? Or do you think you need somewhat of a whole new different kind of device? Just kind of curious how to think about the evolution of the Edge devices from here.
Tim Cook: Yes. As you know, we're shipping an LLM on the iPhone 16 today. And there are -- some of the queries that are being used by our customers are on-device, and then others go to the private cloud where we've essentially mimicked the security and privacy of the device into the cloud. And then others, for world knowledge, are with the integration with ChatGPT. And so there's -- we continue to be very excited about the opportunities here. We are very excited about the road map, and we are pleased with the progress that we're making.
Krish Sankar: Thanks, sir.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Krish. Operator, could we get the next question, please?
Operator: Our next question is from Richard Kramer with Arete Research. Please go ahead.
Richard Kramer: Thank you very much. Wanted to ask about tariffs. Tim, given your recognition that a new Siri system is taking longer than you thought to deliver, I'd like to go back to my question from the last call and ask about what some of the learnings you had from those delays and whether you attribute them to organizational factors, to your legacy software stack? Or is it a matter of R&D spending? And what are some of the key gating factors investors should look for either at WWDC or beyond to have a sense that Apple can deliver on some of the promises of the announcements of the prior WWDC? Thanks.
Tim Cook: Yes. If you sort of step back from what we said at WWDC, we talked about a number of different features that would launch with iOS 18. And we've released a slew of those from Writing Tools to seamlessly connecting to ChatGPT to Genmoji to Image Playground to Image Wand to Clean Up and Visual Intelligence, making movies or movies of your memories with a simple prompt, AI-powered photo search, smart replies, priority notifications, the list goes on. And so we've delivered a lot, and we've just recently, just a few weeks ago, expanded it into several different languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, simplified Chinese as well as localized English for both Singapore and India. So we've delivered a lot. However, with regard to the more personal Siri, as you mentioned, we just need more time to complete the work so they meet our high-quality bar. And there's not a lot of other reason for it. It's just taking a bit longer than we thought. But we are making progress, and we're extremely excited to get the more personal Siri features out there.
Kevan Parekh: And Richard, I'll just add that on your question about investment that we don't underestimate -- underinvest in our business. We make significant investments in R&D. That continues to grow. We're continuing to grow our R&D investment. And so we definitely are making all the investments we think we need to enable our road map.
Richard Kramer: Thanks. And Kevan, 1 for you. I mean, it's hard to ignore some of the ongoing very high-profile legal cases that touch on Apple, be it yesterday's Epic case injunction or the Google antitrust trial touching on default search. And investors are clearly concerned that these might have material impacts on your Services business. Do you feel now that you have ample ways in which you might be able to mitigate some of the potential negative impacts on Apple Services business that might come about from what's been proposed or might come about in legal rather than commercial pressures that the business faces?
Tim Cook: Let me make a couple of comments on that before Kevan. The case yesterday, we strongly disagree with. We've complied with the court's order and we're going to appeal. In the DOJ case that you referenced with Google, that case is ongoing and I don't really have anything to add beyond that. And so we're monitoring these closely. But there -- as you point out, there's risk associated with them and the outcome is unclear.
Kevan Parekh: Yes, I think Tim answered it really well. I don't have anything to add to that.
Richard Kramer: Thank you.
Suhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Richard. Operator, we will take our last question, please.
Operator: We'll go ahead and take our last question from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Aaron Rakers: Yes, thanks for taking the question. I want to go back to the AI strategy a little bit. I know, Tim, in your prepared comments, you had mentioned building some of your own foundational models. And I'm curious of how important you think it is for Apple to have their own foundational models. And kind of dovetailed with that is that, how do you think about your data center footprint when we look at Apple spending, call it, 3 billion a quarter relative to some of these other companies spending multiples of that. How does the strategy play out in your opinion?
Tim Cook: Well, we -- on the data center side, we have a hybrid strategy. And so we utilize third parties in addition to the data center investments that we're making. And as I've mentioned in the 500 billion, there's a number of states that we're expanding in. Some of those are data center investments. And so we do plan on making investments in that area and we're not gating it. We invest in the business first, as Kevan talked about, is our most important thing to do. In terms of the foundation models, we want to have certain models and we'll partner as well. And so I don't view it as a -- all of one or all of the other. We've been working on foundation models for quite some time and are shipping some today, obviously, with what's on-device and what's in the Private Cloud Compute.
